## How we get together - Events and Day revels 

<p>Throughout the year there are several weekends or day event (revels) held across all our different groups (shires and colleges) These are where we dress in medieval appropriate attire, gather to engage in medieval appropriate activities and eat, drink and be merry with period feasting and entertainments. Different events might focus on different activities; for example &quot;Thrust, Piva, Riposte!&quot;	is	a	rapier	and	dancing	event	in	Scotland,	held by the Shire of Harpelstance once a year. Flaming Arrow is an archery event held in Ireland by the Shire of Glen Rathlin, also once a year. Many others are more general, offering a little of everything we do in all our local groups, so you should be able to find something in your area. </p>

<p>Revels are usually day long events, usually aimed at giving newcomers and interested parties a taste of the sort of thing we do. At these events we engage in a mix of activities</p>

<h3>Archery</h3>
<p>With archery we seek to foster the skills developed for entertainment, hunting, and combat as practiced across the medieval period. Archery equipment and techniques varied widely across the area from western Europe, through the middle east to China and Japan, providing a great deal of options for interested archers to explore and reseach.  We use traditional bows and wooden arrows with feather fletchings for target and field shoots.  <br />

<h3>Armoured Combat </h3>
<p>Each of our groups (shires and colleges) have members who are intested in all aspects of medieval life, including medieval fighting styles. Not every group will have a weekly practice, but all will cater for activities at occasional day practices, special weekend practices or at events and revels. In the SCA we have <br>
  Armoured Combat, also known as heavy fighting, where participants armour up and fight with rattan swords.

<h3>Arts and Sciences - Art, crafts, engineering, research and manufacture</h3>
<p>The SCA has been described as the largest medieval craft and research self-help group in the world, and that does not fall short of the mark. The ethos of sharing oneâ€™s knowledge is very strong. People join with whatever skills they have and quickly find that there is great opportunity to learn and improve, to ask questions, to have impromptu workshops and attend a huge range of classes.

<h3> Medieval Fencing </h3>
Fencing is the perfect way to study, replicate and compete with styles of light, heavy and cut-and-thrust weapon sword-fighting found in Europe during the Renaissance period.  This is not fencing in the Olympic style, this is based on ever expanding avenues of research with actual historical manuals.  It is an exciting, fast sport with plenty of style - fighter fight in period clothes - where fighters use blunted steel swords and a variety of off-hand defensive items.  Want to find out just how historically correct your favourite fight scene from a movie is? We have people who can tell you, and recommend texts to recreate your favourite fight more authentically!
