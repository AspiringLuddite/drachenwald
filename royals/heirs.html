  <td><b>About the prince </b><br>
The crown prince can be seen wearing either rus viking, 16th century or 15th century garb. He is usually up late at events and can most days be found around the heavy fighting field (although he enjoys all aspects of events). He also likes entertaining a crowd and putting on a show.

  <td valign="top"><b>About the princess</b><br>
Her royal highness enjoys travels far and wide, to distant shores and bygone times, preferably on horseback. She has a fondness for all things created by ones hand and is known to wield not only needles and sharp wits, but a sword or two or a spear in battle.
