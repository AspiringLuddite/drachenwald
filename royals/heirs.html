  <td  valign="top"><b>About the prince </b><br>
  	William started out as a 12th century Normand and later found 
    a new place in the late 15th century, occationally returning 
    to the earlier times. Over the years he has tried most of the 
    activities the society engages in but those that have been given 
    most time are heavy fighting and crafts, textile and other.

  <td valign="top"><b>About the princess</b><br>
  	Isabetta originates in a lush green part of northern Italy, not 
    far from the mediteranean coast. She lived there in the mid-late 
    15th to early 16th century moving between Venice, Florence and 
    the small town of Portofino. Her pastimes include sewing, handicrafts, 
    baking and socializing. She is well traveled and has gone on 
    pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.
