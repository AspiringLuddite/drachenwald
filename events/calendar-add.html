<caption><h3>Add an Event to the Calendar</h3></caption>

<p>Corpora requires that an event be registered by the seneschal of the sponsoring branch, therefore, this form must be completed by the <strong>branch seneschal</strong>, not the event steward. Please check the calendar before requesting a date to ensure that there is no conflict with Kingdom events, or other events in your region. By requesting a date on the Kingdom Calendar, you are agreeing to make your event official for business. This means you are obliged to provide an event announcement for publication in the Dragon’s Tale (as well as submitting an event financial report and keeping track of non-members). This form will send the information to the Kingdom Web Minister, for the Calendar, and to the Kingdom Chronicler, for the Dragon's Tale. Please note that failure to provide the event announcement information may prevent official business from taking place at your event.</p>

<p>Any queries can be sent to calendar@drachenwald.sca.org</p>
<p>The person filling out the form will get an email with an update link. Updates to your event with this link will be included in the online calendar as well as the Dragon's Tale</p>
