# Proposed Kingdom Law Changes for a Curia

Their Majesties Æiríkr and Jacquelyna give notice that they will hold **an online Curia on Thursday March 27**.

The agenda for this Curia is to review three proposed changes to Drachenwald law and discuss a matter of retiring a pair of silver coronets that have been used for the Royal Heirs but are now too fragile to use. The proposals cover changes to the Glossary, section 5 (Kingdom officers), and section 7.02.2.8.2 (event attendance requirements for Crown Tournament) of Drachenwald law. These proposed changes are being put before the Curia for discussion; the outcome of that discussion may be that any of the proposed changes may be rejected or altered before being implemented into Kingdom law.

All Great Officers of the Kingdom should make every effort to attend this on-line Curia. If Great Officers are unable to do so, they may send a designated representative, or make their comments known to the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal in writing, prior to the day of the Curia. Members of the populace may also send comments in writing to the Crown (crown@drachenwald.sca.org) and Kingdom Seneschal (seneschal@drachenwald.sca.org) in advance of the meeting.

# 1. Proposal to change the Glossary

## Reasoning

The Glossary exists to help the readers of Drachenwald law to navigate through the law text with a full understanding of the contents. It explains terms that are either specific to our Society or specialized words in English.

Since the Glossary is not part of our law text, it can be changed administratively without having to go through the Drachenwald legislative process. Regardless, as the Glossary has now been extensively reviewed, it will be discussed in this Curia.

Most noteworthy of these changes to the Glossary is that the old term "official event" is replaced with two new terms "society event" and "published event". They reflect changes made in the wider Society and Corpora.

The proposal also seeks to add to the approachability of the law with added explanations, and by removing "Court of Chivalry", which has not been conducted in Drachenwald in ages if ever.

Decisions of the Coronet in such matters depend upon the approval of the Crown.

# 2. Proposal to change Drachenwald law section 5

## Reasoning

The proposal removes three Kingdom offices: Kingdom Historian, Kingdom Minister of Youth, and remaining mentions of previously closed Kingdom Chirurgeon's office. The offices of Historian and Minister of Youth have been vacant for quite a while, and the Seneschal’s office regardless of effort has been unable to find volunteers to take these positions. The proposal is therefore changing the law to reflect our reality. The duties related to these offices are currently performed by others. The activities prescribed in the law to Historian are currently handled by the Kingdom Archivist, a deputy reporting directly to the Crown. The Law council recommends removal of the office of Historian from the law and that the Crown and Kingdom Chronicler create a policy regarding archiving and storage of the historical regalia. The current administration of youth affairs is done by the Seneschal’s office. If a separate officer is needed, a deputy can be created with duties described in policy rather than in the Kingdom law.

The proposal removes from section 5.04.2 an officer review process that has only been used sporadically. Reviews, if done properly, can be a magnificent tool in helping people improve the way they handle their offices, but the process described in the current law doesn't seem to suit that purpose. We could not come up with a review process that would actually serve the officers and Kingdom, and as in any volunteer organization reviewing that is done poorly can easily alienate the volunteers, we propose removing this process from the law.

Reasoning for smaller changes:

*   (5.02) The proposal removes the order of precedence that the current law establishes for the Lesser Officers in relation to each other. There is no need for these offices to be compared to each other in such a fashion.

*   (5.03) The proposal removes the statement of the requirement of officers having access to the Dragon’s Tale. The requirement is not removed, but mentioning it is needless as the Kingdom newsletter is now freely available to all.

*   (5.03.2) Section 5.03.7 of the current law has been moved to 5.03.2 where it fits better. The contents were not changed.

*   (5.06.1.10, 5.06.9.2) The proposal changes the stated responsibilities of Chatelaine and Seneschal so that the Seneschal instead of Chatelaine is responsible for the establishment and development of branches, to reflect current practice. Responsibility over developing recruitment remains with Chatelaine.

*   (5.06.2.6) Heraldic funds have not existed separate from the Kingdom account for a long while.

*   Throughout the proposal are writing, spelling and structural changes in order to make these laws more accessible and understandable to all denizens of Drachenwald, including making text capitalization and terminology consistent. For example "Great Officer", "Lesser Officer", "Kingdom officer", and "Society officer" are now capitalized like in Corpora. Additionally Domesday report has been renamed to annual summary report.

# 3. Proposal to change Drachenwald law section 7.02.2.8.2

## Reasoning

The current law text has been found unclear regarding the number of events needed as well as the time frame for when the events happened. This proposal seeks to clarify it and ensure that the participants have both been recently reasonably active within Drachenwald and that they have been a part of this Kingdom for more than just six months.

Please note that this is a requirement that the Crown may waive (according to Kingdom law 7.02.2.8.3), and allow participation in the Crown Tournament to participants who do not fulfil it.

The current law refers to "official events". Corpora has abandoned this description and refers to "published events". In the Glossary section of the Drachenwald law a published event is defined as a "Society event that also fulfils the requirements of Section II.C of the Corpora. These are the events where all manner of court business may be conducted."

## Proposed law text

**7.02.2.8.2 Each participant must have attended at least six published events held in Drachenwald within the 24 months preceding the Crown Tournament.**

**7.02.2.8.2.1 One of the events must be recent (within 6 months before the Crown Tournament).**

**7.02.2.8.2.2 One of the events must be longer ago (between 6 and 24 months before the Crown Tournament).**

~~7.02.2.8.2 Each participant must have attended at least six official events (before Crown Tournament), held in Drachenwald, listed on the Kingdom Calendar in the Dragon's Tale, in the preceding eighteen months. Additionally, each participant must have attended one official event (defined by the same requirements), more than 6 months before Crown Tournament but not more than 24 months before Crown Tournament. This event may be one of the six but does not need to be.~~
