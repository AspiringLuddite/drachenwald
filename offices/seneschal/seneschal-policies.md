  <li><strong>Policies regarding the scheduling of events and the Kingdom Calendar<a name="calendar"></a></strong></li>

  <ol type="A">
    <li>The Kingdom of Drachenwald is separated into three planning regions for the purpose of Kingdom events. These regions are Scandinavia (including Finland), Insulae Draconis, and Central Europe A bid schedule showing the rotation shall be maintained in the Dragon's Tale. Any groups outside these traditional areas may bid for a Kingdom event at any time. This rotation schedule shall not apply to the Kingdom University.</li>
    <li>Drachenwald will have the following five regions:</li> 
    <ol>
      <li>Aarnimets√§ (Finland)</li>
      <li>Nordmark (Sweden)</li>
      <li>Insulae Draconis (United Kingdom, Ireland, Iceland)</li>
      <li>Central (Germany, Austria, Denmark, The Netherlands, France, Russian Federation, Belgium)</li>
      <li>South (Spain, Greece, Italy, Israel, and South Africa)</li>
    </ol>

    <li>For the purpose of local events, the Kingdom is split into five regions as noted above.  		  Only the first event requested for a given weekend per region will be official unless the  		  following group's event request includes a letter of acceptance from the event steward of the official event for the given date.  If the distance between the hosting groups is greater than 310 miles/500 Kilometers, it will also be considered an official event without the letter of acceptance from the original event date holder.  It is encouraged that local groups attempt to avoid dual scheduling in a given region, where possible.   As per kingdom law, no other official event can be held on the weekend of a kingdom event, whether in the same region or different.</li>
    <li>Any branch wishing to hold an event must contact the Chronicler/Deputy for the Kingdom  		  Calendar in order to check for and reserve open dates. Contact can be made via phone, e-mail, or by submitting a date request via the Kingdom web site.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Events may be registered up to 2 years in advance. </li>
      <li>Events must be sponsored by a recognized full branch. Incipient branches should have events sponsored by their sponsoring branch. </li>
      <li>Local branches should work with each other and contact each other if there are difficulties with events. </li>
      <li>After the event date is approved, copies of flyers and event announcements must be sent to the Kingdom Chronicler's </li>
