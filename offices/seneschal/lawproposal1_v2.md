Greetings to all these letters find, and special thanks and salutations to everyone who helped the Law Council and the Kingdom by studying the initial drafts of our first law proposals and seeing how they could be improved.

The proposals have now been revisited based on the feedback received, and, with a  summary of your feedback, given to Crown to decide how they wish to proceed with them.

# Addressing the feedback on July draft proposals

The first proposal - removing gender requirements from participation in the Crown List - received no critique, only some encouragement, so we have advanced it to their Majesties as it was.

The second proposal - rather extensive update on the descriptions of the awards and orders of our Kingdom - generated more comments from the wider court. The feedback was in favour of the overall direction of the changes, and we received some suggestions for improvements as well as questions regarding unclarities.

Many remarked on something which we had overlooked in the draft proposal, that while Crown Tournament gender requirements are proposed to be removed, the law still refers to "the Crown Prince and Princess" in 9.03.4. In the updated version this now reads as "Royal Heirs"; a descriptor also used in Corpora (see the [Governing Documents of the SCA](https://www.sca.org/resources/document-library/)). Related to this, and particularly regarding changing "King and Queen" in several parts of the law into "Sovereign and Consort", we wish to stress that 'Sovereign' and 'Consort' are roles related to the SCA Crown, and the holders of these roles will also hold titles of King or Queen (or equivalent title) based on their own choices. There is absolutely no intent in the proposal to retire titles, only clarify the law text to not use titles when referring to roles.

In the same context some commenters were also asking about gender neutral titles. In our Society all titles are controlled at the Society level. Corpora reserves this power to the SCA Board of Directors that has delegated the practicalities to the SCA College of Arms. Thus creating new titles is not appropriate for kingdom legislation. There are initiatives in the College of Arms to find gender neutral alternative titles; in English such have so far been found for the armiger titles (Award or Grant of Arms). Reflecting the options, in this proposal "Lord or Lady of the Rose" and "Lord or Lady of the Edelweiss" are now accompanied with "or an equivalent title" to allow for regional or gender neutral variants of 'Lord' or 'Lady'. The full listing of alternative titles in various languages is published at <http://heraldry.sca.org/titles.html>.

The question regarding gender neutral titles was also raised in relation to the Sigillum. In both the current law and the proposed law the variants of this award are named using the Latin translations of the titles King and Queen; so far no gender neutral options are available. To change the overall naming of this award is beyond the scope of this particular proposal.

Another widely made comment addressed the curious way that the heraldic tincture ‘Or’ (yellow/gold) is capitalised in blazon (armorial description). The law text uses blazon when describing most symbols for the orders and awards because those symbols are heraldic insignia registered as such with the SCA College of Arms, and the Kingdom law ought to strive for consistency with the official registrations. In SCA blazon this particular tincture 'Or' is capitalised to differentiate it from the English conjunction 'or'. The proposal retains this while removing erroneous capitalising of other tinctures ("Sable").

We also received most welcome guidance in some German and Latin grammar used in the law text. In the updated proposal Orden des Linguistringes is consistently capitalised correctly according to German practice, and instead of using an incorrect plural form of the Latin word 'sigillum', the text sticks to singular; this makes more sense when discussing an order name.

Some commenters found it odd that closed orders occur in the middle of the fuller list of orders. In the law the orders are divided into armigerous and non-armigerous orders, chapters 10 and 11. The closed orders are armigerous orders and thus appear in the law text at the very end of chapter 10.

A symbol has not yet been chosen for the Order of the Dragon's Pride, and so the current law text names it as "(reserved)". Suggestion was received to replace it with "has not been chosen". Trusting that the law will be updated properly once the symbol eventually is chosen, the proposal does not include this suggested change.

Compared to the July draft proposal, the following changes have been made:

* (9.03.4) "Crown Prince and Crown Princess" was changed to "Royal Heirs" that is also used in Corpora.

* (10.02.1.2, 10.02.2.1, 10.03.4.1, 10.03.5.1) The word "people" was removed from some award texts as unnecessary.

* (10.02.3.1) In a feedback "prowess at arms" in the description of the Order of the Silver Guard was interpreted to exclude archery. To prevent this, "martial prowess" replaces it in this proposal.

* (10.02.4.2, 10.04.1.1) "Lord or Lady of the Rose" and "Lord or Lady of the Edelweiss" are now accompanied with "or an equivalent title" to allow for regional or gender neutral variants of 'Lord' or 'Lady'.

* (11.04.3.1.1-4) English translations have been added for the Latin names of the Sigillum.

* Some minor grammar corrections.

Once again, our most heartfelt thanks to all who commented and helped us either with suggestions, advice or encouragement. Please find the updated proposals below.

# 1 Proposal to change Drachenwald law 7.02.2.1 (August 17)

## Reasoning

The purpose of the proposed change is to have the kingdom law reflect Corpora regarding the removal of gender requirements for participating in Crown List. Additionally the word "Consort" is changed to "consort" for consistency.

Corpora IV.B.1 used to be:

> Each competitor in a Royal List must be fighting for a prospective consort of the opposite sex unless the Crown has elected to permit a competitor to fight for a prospective consort of the same sex.

On 19 October 2019, Corpora IV.B.1 was changed to:

> Each competitor in a Royal List must be fighting for a prospective consort.

## Formatting

In the proposed law text below, added text is marked with **bold** and removed text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~. All other text is unchanged from the current law text.

## Proposed law text

7.02.2.1 Each competitor in the Crown Tournament must be fighting for a prospective consort ~~of the opposite sex unless the Crown has elected to permit a competitor to fight for a prospective consort of the same sex~~. The competitor and prospective **consort** ~~Consort~~ are referred to as "Participants" in these laws.

# 2 Proposal to change Drachenwald law 9-11 (August 17)

## Reasoning

The award sections have gone through some reworking to achieve three things. 

1. The most important changes acknowledge that the roles of Sovereign and Consort are not gendered although the titles King and Queen are. One important consideration in the proposal has been to not change the existing awards but prepare as much as possible for events that were not considered when the award was created.

   - The Order of the Companions of Albion (11.02) has in fact been registered with the SCA College of Arms without the word "King" in it and won’t need further actions.

   - The Queen's Order of Courtesy of Drachenwald (11.03) is called The Order of Courtesy in the proposed text. The purpose of the award has not changed. As before, it is conferred by Consort.

   - The Sigillum is and has always been awarded either jointly by the Crown or separately by Sovereign or by Consort. The proposed changes in the law text do not change this, nor do they change the symbols of the award variants. The original law text presumes King Sovereign and Queen Consort and fails to address Queen Sovereign, King Consort, and situations where both of the rulers use either King or Queen as their titles. The proposed law recognises the difference between the role (Sovereign and Consort) and the title (King/Queen) of a ruler of the kingdom, and provides the appropriate award names for the various combinations. The name of the award reflects the title of the one bestowing it (King’s -> Regis; Queen’s -> Reginae). The symbol of the award, however, reflects the role (Sovereign or Consort, or both together). This is the case currently, and is merely clarified in the proposed text. This award was originally created in principality days. When Drachenwald became a kingdom, some other – and potentially more gender-neutral – options were considered but were turned down by the SCA College of Arms. 

2. The second change was to unify the style and way how the awards have been written to the law. The most significant change is related to Ordo Annuli (10.03).

   - A style issue was observed in capitalisation related to awards. In the current law the use has been very mixed even within the same sentence. In the proposed text, "award" or "order" are capitalised as part of the name of an award/order, for example the Order of X. When writing about awards and orders in general, no capitalisation is done unless the word is at the beginning of a sentence.

   - Awards and orders have symbols, but only some of those are registered badges. To avoid confusion the proposed law uses only the word "symbol".

3. The third part of the changes includes correcting the language to use better English as well as some added clarifications to some of the awards.

## Formatting

In the proposed law text below, added text is marked with **bold** and removed text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~. All other text is unchanged from the current law text.

## Proposed law text

9.00 GRANTING AWARDS

9.01 Only the Crown of Drachenwald may grant kingdom awards in accordance with Kingdom law.

9.02 Both the Sovereign and Consort must agree upon any awards given by the Crown, except as specified below.

9.03.1 Any polling for a candidate must be sent to all members of the **order** ~~Order~~ residing in Drachenwald. The members of the **order** ~~Order~~ must be allowed at least thirty days to reply to the polling.

9.03.2 The original polling for each individual must be in writing. Subsequent polling need not be, although the Crown is urged to do so.

9.03.3 Since people and membership in orders change, in order to give a polling award to any person, the polling on the person must have been done in the last year. If at least 80% of the circle is present at a given event, a decision to elevate can be made with a verbal polling of the circle even if the last written polling is more than 1 year old.
