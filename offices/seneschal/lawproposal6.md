6.05 Territorial Baronies

6.05.1 While the Corpora provide for the basic terms on how territorial baronies are
established, Drachenwald has the following extra requirements:

6.05.1.1 The petitioning group must be able to guarantee that the minimum requirements
specified in Corpora will be maintained between the time of filing and the time of approval by
the Board of Directors.

6.05.1.2 The petitioning branch must have a sustained record of activities, including the
hosting of Principality or Kingdom-wide events.

6.05.1.3 Request for the advancement to baronial status must be coordinated through the Crown (and Coronet, if the branch is within a Principality), as well as the Kingdom (and Principality) Seneschal.

6.05.2 The rulership of a Baronial fief shall be awarded by the Crown or Coronet upon petition by the members of the Barony in question.

6.05.3 When a Barony is left without at least one Baronial ruler the following procedures are
in effect:

6.05.3.1 The outgoing Baronial ruler(s) shall appoint a Vicar as a temporary replacement. If
this does not occur within ten days of the Baronial ruler(s) departure, the Crown or Coronet will appoint a Vicar. The Vicar shall hold no baronial office.

6.05.3.2 Within ninety days of the naming of the Vicar, the membership shall be polled to determine the future of the branch; to remain as a Barony, to change to non-baronial branch status, or dissolve the branch. This polling will be conducted by the Vicar and the Baronial Officers under the supervision of the Kingdom or Principality Seneschal. The results of this polling are due to the Crown or Coronet within thirty days of the poll being taken.

6.05.3.2.1 If the Barony members wish to dissolve the branch or change to non-baronial
status, the Baronial Seneschal will coordinate with the Kingdom or Principality Seneschal on the necessary communications with the Society Seneschal, or the Board of Directors through the Society Seneschal. The Vicar shall retire at the end of the transition period.

6.05.3.2.2 If the Barony members wish to remain a Barony, they must select Baronial ruler(s). The recommendation process must occur within one year from when the Vicar was named. At this time the group may send a petition to the Crown or Coronet naming its candidates (either an individual or a couple). The Vicar retires once the proposed Baronial rulership is approved by the Crown or Coronet.

6.05.3.2.2.1 If the Barony members are unable to select a Baronial ruler(s) in the time
allowed, the members will be polled to select a non-baronial branch status. The branch may
not apply for Baronial status for at least two years. The Vicar retires on the day of the polling.

6.05.4 At any time the members of a Barony may petition the Crown or Coronet for the appointment of a Baronial ruler Baron/Baroness If a Barony has only a single Baronial ruler, the members of the Barony may petition the Crown or Coronet for the appointment of an additional Baronial ruler to rule with its current Baronial ruler.

6.05.5 In the event that the members of the Barony in question wish to remove one or both
Baronial rulers, they must first seek arbitration through the grievance procedure outlined in
12.02.2.

6.05.5.1 If it is the finding of the arbitrators that the best solution to the difficulties is the
removal or suspension of either or both Baronial rulers, the membership shall submit a
petition to that effect, signed by at least two-thirds of the members, to the Crown or Coronet. The arbitrators will submit a report of their findings as specified in Drachenwald Law.

6.05.6 Baronial rulers have the right to give non-armigerous awards and positions of honour.

6.05.7 Baronial rulers hold their Baronies in Fealty to the Crown, or to the Coronet if the Barony is within a Principality. They must present this fealty at Coronation or Investiture, as appropriate, either in person, through an envoy, or in writing.

6.05.8 The length of a single term for a Baronial ruler is a maximum of two years. After
consulting with the members of the Barony, the Crown or Coronet may, at their discretion, ask one or both of the Baronial rulers to serve another term. It is recommended that no Baronial ruler serve more than two consecutive terms.

6.05.9 Any person holding a Baronial fief in Drachenwald must step down from office when no longer residing in the Barony.

6.05.10 Any person holding a Baronial fief in Drachenwald may participate in the Crown List
and, if applicable, a Coronet List. They are required to submit the name of an acceptable
candidate for Vicar with other documentation required for participation in the Crown or Coronet List. Should the Baronial rulers be victorious in the Crown or Coronet Tournament, the Vicar assumes responsibility for the Barony immediately. The Vicar must conduct a polling for the new Baronial rulers within 90 days.
