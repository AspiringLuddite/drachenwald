## Introduction

In order for the laws of our kingdom to help us function better, we need to revise them from time to time. The Seneschal of Drachenwald has appointed a [Law Council]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/seneschal/law-council.md %}) to consider adjustments to our laws, to consult the members and participants in Drachenwald, and based on that work to recommend changes to the Seneschal and Crown who may then choose to discuss these changes at a future Curia.

These proposed Drachenwald law changes continue gender neutral changes in Section 6, Section 11 and 13. Officer requirements for all branch levels are more well defined in section 6.04.1. There is also a proposal to move the Social Media office from the Kingdom Web minister to Kingdom Seneschal. Fuller descriptions of all changes are below.  

## Giving feedback on the draft law proposals

We are asking you to take a moment to read the proposals and share your thoughts via the provided form. 
The period for commenting on the following draft law proposals ends on December 28.
You can always reach the Law Council at law@drachenwald.sca.org.

## Draft proposal to change Drachenwald Law section 6

### Reasoning

The main motivation behind these changes is to remove gender specificity where it isn’t needed or it is inconsistent with other parts of the law. A secondary set of changes is to make the text of the law consistent regarding terminology and capitalization.

Reasoning for particular changes:
(6.01-6.03) References to Prince/Princess in Principality territories have been replaced by the term Coronet. This term is used in the same context as Crown. 

(6.05) References to Baron/Baroness have been replaced by the general term Baronial Rulers.  Section 6.05.2.1 has been added to define Baron, Baroness and Baronex titles. 

(6.04.1) Officer requirements are more fully defined at the Principality, Barony and local branch levels. These are the requirements found in Corpora. 

A few wording changes have also been made in certain sections.  

### Formatting

In the law text below, added text is **bold** and removed text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~.

## Draft proposal to move the Kingdom Social Media Office to the Kingdom Seneschal

### Reasoning
This proposal moves the Kingdom Social Media office responsibility from the Kingdom Web Minister to the Kingdom Seneschal.  The Social Media office at SCA corporate level reports to the Society Seneschal. This change makes the Kingdom Social Media reporting consistent with the same reporting structure.  It remains a Lesser office.

### Proposed law text
