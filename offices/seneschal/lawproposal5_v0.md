# Introduction

In order for the laws of our kingdom to help us function better, we need to revise them from time to time. The Seneschal of Drachenwald has appointed a [Law Council]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/seneschal/law-council.md %}) to consider adjustments to our laws, to consult the members and participants in Drachenwald, and based on that work to recommend changes to the Seneschal and Crown who may then choose to discuss these changes at a future Curia.
