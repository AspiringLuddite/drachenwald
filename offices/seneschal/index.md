## Drachenwald Law Council

This council will work with the Kingdom Seneschal office to assist in all phases of making Kingdom Law changes.  This includes:
* Regularly review of current Kingdom law to insure it is in compliance with SCA Corpora and real world law.
* Research and provide rational of why changes are necessary and giving (writing) examples of how these changes would impact activities within the Kingdom of Drachenwald.  
* Draft appropriate new law text to be added to the Kingdom law document for any proposed change.
* Assist the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal in preparing the proposals for publication in the Dragonâ€™s Tale with both law text changes and rational.
* Assist the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal in publicizing the proposed changes after the Curia announcement.
* Assist the Crown in preparation of materials and information to be presented at the Curia meeting.
* After the Curia, assist the Kingdom Seneschal with publishing a summary of the Curia meeting, and publicizing the changes.
