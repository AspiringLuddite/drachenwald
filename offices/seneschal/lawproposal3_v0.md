# Introduction

In order for the laws of our kingdom to help us function better, we need to revise them from time to time. The Seneschal of Drachenwald has appointed a [Law Council]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/seneschal/law-council.md %}) to consider adjustments to our laws, to consult the members and participants in Drachenwald, and based on that work to recommend changes to the Seneschal and Crown who may then choose to discuss these changes at a future Curia.

# Giving feedback on the draft law proposals

The period for commenting on the following draft law proposals ended on 18 December 2020. Thank you for all the feedback we received!

# 1. Proposal to change Drachenwald law 1 (December 3)

## Reasoning

The first section in the current law is somewhat difficult to read and has problems conveying its intentions. This proposal restructures and partially rewrites it.

Some previously implicit parts have been written more clearly, taking advantage of examples set in East Kingdom and Lochac laws. These additions are fitted to the reality of our Kingdom (multiple affiliates whose contracts create By-Law level obligations).

The current law text also contains some outdated parts that have been rewritten in this proposal to reflect current practices, or removed altogether.

Reasoning for particular changes:

* (1.01-1.02) The precedence of the body of laws has always been defined in the governing documents of the SCA. This is now explicitly noted. The body of laws has been clarified and now includes affiliates.

* The laws governing changing of laws and edicts have been divided into separate sections (1.03.3 for laws, 1.03.4 for edicts) for clarity. Although the text has been simplified, the process of changing laws has not been changed in this proposal.

* A change is proposed to the section on creating edicts: The Royal Heirs to the Crown would receive the option to publish edicts in the *Dragon's Tale* before their Coronation. This change would make possible edicts that would last for an entire reign. It would solve the problem caused by the off-set between the dates for publication of the *Dragon's Tale* and the dates of the Coronation events, which has resulted in delays between Coronation and the date when an edict could take effect.

* The proposal also makes explicit the requirement of Crown proclaiming edicts at an event for them to take effect.

* (1.04) This proposal eliminates the required paper publication of Drachenwald law. In the past the law was regularly published as the Great Book of Laws containing Drachenwald law, officer policies, and a list of past monarchs of Drachenwald. Such a publication of law and policies has not been made for years, and with the world wide web being as accessible as it is today, we believe that publication on the Kingdom Website is sufficient for our purposes. This also removes the need to involve the Kingdom Chronicler in the publication of the law. (Note that this is a separate matter from when laws are changed; both the proposed laws as well as pending laws continue to be published in the *Dragon's Tale*.)

* As the "Great Book of Law" had a very particular meaning related to paper publishing of law and policies, it is not included in this proposal. The law council suggests that the Great Book of Law could be reborn as a section on the Kingdom Website, linking together the law and the policies, but recognises that this matter belongs to Kingdom Webminister.

* The single definition of “written” has been expanded into a sub-section where other such definitions can be added when necessary.

The rewriting and reorganizing of the section was so extensive that the typical way of showing changed text was not suitable. In the law text below, all proposed text is **bold** and all old law text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~.

# 2. Proposal to change Drachenwald law 2-5 (December 3)

## Reasoning

The main motivation behind these changes is to remove gender specificity where it isn't needed or it is inconsistent with other parts of the law.

A secondary set of changes is to make the text of the law consistent regarding terminology and capitalization.

Reasoning for particular changes:

* (2.03.5, 3.02.1) In the current law "Sanctum" is defined as an area ten feet radius surrounding the throwns and the Crown's presence. Many event venues make it challenging to observe such a set radius, so the proposal has removed the exact measure. Neither the word "Sanctum" nor the measurement are found in Corpora. the proposal has replaced both with "the right to a zone of respectful distance surrounding the thrones and the Crown's presence, into which others may enter only upon invitation of a monarch."

* (2.04) Although the descriptions for failures of succession and regency have been clarified, they have not been otherwise changed.

## Formatting

In the law text below, added text is **bold** and removed text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~. All other text is unchanged from the current law text.
