# Proposed Kingdom Law Changes for a Curia

Their Majesties Morales and Eila give notice that they intend to hold an online Curia Regis on Thursday March 24, 2022 at 7pm CET. 

The agenda for this Curia is to review the following proposed law changes:
*   Gender neutral changes in Section 6, Section 11 and 13. 
*   Better defined officer requirements for all branch levels in section 6.04.1. 
*   A proposal to move the Social Media office from the Kingdom Web minister to Kingdom Seneschal in section 5.06.13.1.  

Fuller descriptions of all proposed changes are below. Any new business may be brought up after the law change discussion. 

These proposed changes are being put before the Curia for discussion. The outcome of that discussion may be that any of the proposed changes may be rejected, or altered before being implemented into Kingdom Law. 

This Curia will be announced on the Kingdom website, by social media and the Drachenwald email list. All Great Officers of the Kingdom should make every effort to attend this online Curia. If Great Officers are unable to do so, they may send a designated representative, or make their comments known to the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal in writing, by March 23, 2022. Members of the populace may also send comments in writing to the Crown (crown@drachenwald.sca.org) and Kingdom Seneschal (seneschal@drachenwald.sca.org) in advance of the meeting. 


# 1. Proposal to change Drachenwald Law section 6

## Reasoning

The main motivation behind these changes is to remove gender specificity where it isn’t needed or it is inconsistent with other parts of the law. A secondary set of changes is to make the text of the law consistent regarding terminology and capitalization.

Reasoning for particular changes:

(6.01-6.03) References to Prince/Princess in Principality territories have been replaced by the term Coronet. This term is used in the same context as Crown. 

(6.04.1) Officer requirements are more fully defined at the Principality, Barony and local branch levels. These are the requirements found in Corpora. 

A few wording changes have also been made in certain sections.

## Reasoning

This proposal moves the Kingdom Social Media office responsibility from the Kingdom Web Minister to the Kingdom Seneschal.  The Social Media office at SCA corporate level reports to the Society Seneschal. This change makes the Kingdom Social Media reporting consistent with the same reporting structure.  It remains a Lesser office.
