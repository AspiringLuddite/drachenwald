title: Kingdom code of conduct 
excerpt: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, on behalf of the kingdom seneschal's office

---

See the [current code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s64pYidD6lnTP0x6wdTwWXCiStgOKSPef-Zm4ENj-3Q/edit) on Googledocs.

This document is a policy, not an addition to the Kingdom laws. 

Each SCA affiliated membership group  is welcome to adopt this policy as it is, or to develop something that suits their purposes better, as long as it reflects the SCA Core Values. 

To address the existing gap in the Kingdom, and to reflect the best practice across the SCA, with the agreement of the Kingdom Seneschal we formed a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Council. We began our work in January 2020.

This council will work with the Kingdom Seneschal to 

* increase awareness of matters relevant to the council
* offer and provide training and education to individuals and groups
* maintain and develop the Code of Conduct document
* provide support and advice if requested in any cases of complaint relating to a breach of the Code of Conduct

The Council is not the first point of contact for complaints. It does not comment on any specific cases, police events, or have any arbitrating or deciding power regarding sanctions, which will follow the same processes and procedures as they have done so far. 

The Council members operate independent of their SCA personae, ranks, titles, or other offices. 

The first councillors, who will be replaced respectively in 12, 18, and 24 months, are Linda Holmberg, André Corterier and Mika Mäkelä.
