# Kingdom of Drachenwald: Code of Conduct, Anti-bullying & Harassment Policy, and Complaints Process

## Purpose

The Society for Creative Anachronism (the SCA), operating in the Kingdom of Drachenwald through a number of affiliated entities and SCA Inc. is committed to promoting and supporting the positive aspects of pre-17th century historical recreation. We do this through the lens of our contemporary values of equality, inclusivity and support of diversity in order to ensure a good and enriching social experience. 

The aims of this Code are as follows: 
To ensure that the Society’s core values, good reputation and positive behaviours are maintained by all participants; 
To provide a simple code that assists in delivering a safe, fair, and inclusive environment to our members in all our activities including events, meetings, practices and online spaces; 
To deter conduct that could damage the Society by impairing public confidence in the integrity and good character of participants and the Society as a whole;
To provide a clear pathway for members, officers and Royalty alike to recognise problems and the right protocol to act when an incident takes place or action is required;
To create clarity across different cultural social interactions and several different language areas, which is essential in a kingdom such as Drachenwald.  

This Code of Conduct will be made available in all the languages actively used by members in Drachenwald. At all times, local laws, local jurisdiction, and local definitions of terms relating to issues considered in this document will take precedence. It is understood that each affiliate has its own set of rules, laws and policies, and this document is not intended to supersede those unless an affiliate wishes to adopt this policy as is. 

This Code of Conduct will apply to all those participating in official events, official practices and online activity in Drachenwald, regardless of whether or not they are a paying member of SCA Inc or an affiliate. 

### What this Code of Conduct is and what it is not

This Code of Conduct is a set of guiding rules that outline the standards of our society. It sets up both responsibilities and rights for our members. It explains our expectations of everyone’s behaviour during all our activities and interactions, regardless of whether these take place online or offline. 

On its own, this Code of Conduct will not be able to prevent the kind of problems that are referred to here. Nor will its existence prevent its potential malicious exploitation. 

This Code is not a legal document in terms of our civil jurisdictions. The civil laws across the many countries in our kingdom are varied. All participants in all our activities, online and offline, are bound by the relevant local laws. 

The success of this Code and its intentions are not dependent on the actions of a small group, such as the Kingdom Officers or our Royalty. In order for Drachenwald to be an environment of joy and fun, all those participating in the kingdom’s activities need to actively work towards creating a positive and inclusive atmosphere. 
 
This Code will be subject to constant development and evolving according to any new needs that may appear or should we discover that elements of it are not working in practice.


## SCA Core Values

In pursuing its mission, the SCA is committed to excellence in its programs, communications and activities and to  
- act in accordance with the chivalric virtues of honor and service
- value and respect the worth and dignity of all individuals
- practice inclusiveness and respect pluralism and diversity
- promote a safe and respectful environment for all SCA events
- act with transparency, fairness, integrity and honesty
- be a responsible steward of SCA resources; and, 
- be committed to maintaining the trust of its members and participants. 

It is the expectation of the SCA that its members and participants, in all events and activities of the SCA, will conduct themselves in accordance with these tenets.


## Our expectations of you

Further to our Core Values, in all our spaces, in our events, practices, meetings, online spaces, and other activities, you are expected to: 
- Be polite toward other SCA participants as well as toward any members of the public who may attend some of our events;
- Respect other people and respect their needs: if you are not sure, please ask. This includes valuing personal confidentiality; 
- Take all reasonable steps to make everyone feel welcome and safe within our society, regardless of gender identity, age, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or body type; 
- Act with care and due diligence, accepting responsibility for your actions and using SCA resources in a proper manner;
- Not engage in any acts of abuse or misconduct, including but not limited to bullying, harassment,
victimisation, assault including physical or sexual assault, grooming, or unlawful discrimination;
- Not engage in hate speech, including the use of symbols that may be perceived as offensive to a large segment of the SCA or the general public in order to uphold the integrity and good reputation of the SCA;
- Not use the Society to promote personal beliefs (including politics), behaviours or practices that are incompatible with the principles outlined in this Code of Conduct;
- Comply with any lawful and reasonable directions given by a person having the authority to give the direction;
- Speak up if you have a reasonable concern regarding a breach of this Code, provided that you feel safe doing so. 
- Seek to provide help and support if a person is unsafe or uncomfortable as a result of another person’s actions, according to the best of your ability and according to their needs. Help them to speak to the event steward/moderator/seneschal/another appropriate SCA authority if they wish to do so.


## Undesirable behaviour, harassment and bullying

The SCA prohibits bullying and harassment of all individuals and groups. Bullying is systematic (repetitive) and unwelcome behavior which involves the use of influence, threat, intimidation, or coercion to cause hurt or harm to another person or group of people. When the bullying behavior is based on a protected class (race, sex, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability), that behavior is defined as harassment.

### Bullying and Harassment may be: 


(1) Overt, as in the following non-inclusive list of examples:
- Verbal abuse, including using racial, homophobic, transphobic, ableist epithets, etc.
- Non-consensual physical contact, violence, or threatening words or gestures
- Displaying material that is offensive, degrading, or threatening to a protected class
- Consistent demeaning remarks or malicious teasing
- Stalking or predatory behavior 

(2) Covert:
- Spreading rumors or innuendo with malicious intent
- Deliberate exclusion, isolation, or alienation of an individual without just cause
- Using rank, title, or office to intimidate others

These examples are not exhaustive and the kingdom Diversity, Equity & Inclusivity Council (dei@drachenwald.sca.org) are happy to provide advice if you have any questions.  

**Provided that the behavior does not rise to the criteria listed above, bullying and harassment is not:**
- Single episodes of social rejection, dislike, tactlessness, or forgetfulness
- Mutual arguments, disagreements, or fights
- The termination, mutual or not, of a romantic relationship or friendship
- Reasonable constructive feedback or critique

The test for bullying is the reasonableness of the repetitive behavior and the impact of that behavior on the recipient.

**The Seneschalate and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding:**

- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive or discriminatory behavior or assumptions


### Sexual misconduct

The SCA prohibits all forms of sexual misconduct including, but not limited to, sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual violence. Such conduct violates SCA Core Values and puts the SCA and its participants at risk. 

Any sexual activity that does not involve consent from everyone participating is understood as sexual misconduct.

**Definitions:** 

**Consent:** freely and affirmatively communicated willingness to participate in sexual activity, expressed by clear, unambiguous words. 
- Consent is a clear, verbal, voluntary agreement given by someone able to agree to an act. 
- Someone may lack the ability to consent, due, for example, to their age, intellectual or other disability, or incapacitation from the use of drugs or alcohol. 
- We will always view as unwelcome and nonconsensual any sexual activity between an adult and any person below the legal age of consent. 
- Additionally, because consent is a voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity: 
    (1) someone who is incapacitated cannot consent; 
    (2) past consent does not imply future consent; 
    (3) consent for one act does not imply consent for another; 
    (4) silence or an absence of resistance does not imply consent; 
    (5) consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another; 
    (6) consent can be withdrawn at any time; and 
    (7) coercion, force, or threat of either invalidates consent 

**Sexual Assault:** an actual or attempted sexual contact with another person without that person's consent. Sexual assault includes, but is not limited to, acts that constitute sexual assault under the relevant civil or criminal jurisdiction. 

**Sexual Harassment:** any unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive such that it unreasonably interferes with, limits or deprives someone of the ability to participate in or benefit from the SCA events and activities. Sexual Harassment includes, but is not limited to, acts that constitute sexual harassment under the relevant civil or criminal jurisdiction. 

**Sexual Misconduct:** any unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that is committed without consent and/or by force, intimidation, coercion, or manipulation. Sexual misconduct includes, but is not limited to, exposure of reproductive organs, sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual violence. Sexual misconduct also includes, but is not limited to, acts that constitute sexual misconduct under relevant civil or criminal jurisdiction. 

**Stalking:** engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to (a) fear for his or her safety or the safety of others, or (b) suffer substantial emotional distress. 

Stalking behavior can include: (i) persistent, unwanted communications to the victim by phone, email, and/or other social media; (ii) repeatedly sending the victim unwanted gifts; (iii) following or waiting for the victim at home, school, work, or elsewhere; and (iv) direct or indirect threat(s) by the stalker to harm herself or himself, the victim, or the victim’s friends and family, or to damage the victim’s property. Stalking includes, but is not limited to, acts that constitute stalking under relevant civil or criminal jurisdiction.

## How to report and what happens next

Remember that reporting a problem, no matter how small, will help Drachenwald grow into a safer and more open place. Drachenwald holds its people to a high standard and the participants in our activities should always feel safe. Reporting issues is important particularly so that we can identify any pattern of behaviour and whether any further measures to prevent that kind of behaviour need to be taken. 

The Seneschalate and the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse as far as possible. You will not be identified to the person who has harassed you, to the participants in the Kingdom activities or the general public, during or after the complaint process without your consent. You will not be made to contact the person who has harassed you or to confront them face to face. However please note that if formal arbitration is agreed to, then the identity of the person making the complaint is made known to the person accused of harassment. Similarly, if the issue has been made public in some other manner prior to the start of the formal process, it is possible for the identities of the individuals involved to become known outside the remit of the complaint process. .  

The below process is NOT intended to address individual acts which fall within the jurisdiction of a civil or criminal court maintained by the nation or other political division where it takes place, nor shall any recommendation about individuals be made on such issues. Any actions of this type should be brought to the IMMEDIATE attention of the Kingdom Seneschal. Additionally, if you are subject to any such actions, you will be advised to bring the issue to civil authorities such as the police and we will support you at this.

**Step 1:**

If you feel that you have been subjected to harassment, bullying or any other breach of the Code of Conduct, or you have been witness to someone breaking the Code of Conduct in any way, you can ask that person to stop - as long as you feel safe and comfortable enough to do that. 

Bear in mind that in some cases the offending person may not have been aware of the effect of their words and actions, particularly due to linguistic and cultural differences within Drachenwald.  

**Step 2:**

If the person does not stop, or if you feel that you can not engage with them for any reason, please make sure that you are safe (removing yourself from the situation if possible) and then talk to someone who can help you. 

| Activity space | First contact point |
| :- - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - -: |
| Event | Event Steward or designated staff |
| Online space (Facebook, mailing list, Discord/Slack, etc) | Moderator or Administrator |
| Meeting | Person running the meeting |
| Martial practice (armoured combat, fencing, archery) | Marshal |

If the person harassing you is the contact person or part of the complaints handling process, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. In such a case, please in the first instance speak to another event staff member, another moderator, another officer, or another person of relevant authority. Your local seneschal is always a useful person to report any issues to. 

**Step 3**

If the attempt to resolve the issue with the help of the first contact point (as above) is not successful, you may escalate the issue:

1. Appropriate local officers
2. Appropriate baronial officers (if applicable)
3. Appropriate principality officers (if applicable)
4. Appropriate kingdom officers
 			


**Step 4**

After all lesser avenues of redress have been exhausted, you may submit a written Petition for Redress to the Crowns with a copy going to the Kingdom Seneschal. The Crowns and the Kingdom Seneschal will review the petition. They will investigate and if they consider the petition to be legitimate, either initiate the arbitration process (See Drachenwald Law 12.02.2 Petition for Redress) or initiate the sanction process as they deem appropriate. 

**Step 5**

If you consider the response from the Kingdom Seneschal and the Crown to be unsatisfactory, your final option to escalate the issue is to contact Drachenwald’s SCA Board Ombudsman and/or Society Seneschal in order to make a direct complaint to the SCA Inc. Board.


## Consequences 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 

Consequences of breaching the Code of Conduct include:

| Sanction | Issued by | Duration | Appeal |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Being asked to leave the space in which the breach has taken place. This includes but is not limited to: leaving the practice/meeting/event, being temporarily or permanently banned from online communities. | Person/people responsible for the practice/meeting/event; moderator/s of the online community, local seneschal |  Flexible depending on the case | Informal |
|If the person who has breached the Code is an officer, they may be suspended or removed from their office.|Superior officer or the Crown|90 days/Reign|No|
|The Crown may banish the person in breach of the Code from the Royal Presence, which means the banished person may not attend Royal Court, attend meetings where the Crown is present, contact the Crown in any manner or be within 15 metres of the Crown.| The Crown | Reign | No |
| Exile from the Kingdom, which means that the person sanctioned may not participate in any SCA activity within the Kingdom including online spaces such as social media.  | The Crown | Reign | Board of Directors |
| Temporary removal from participation from the Society: the person sanctioned may not participate in any SCA activity anywhere. | The Crown and Kingdom Seneschal after consultation with the Society Seneschal. | Until the Board makes a final decision on the Sanction | Board of Directors (with new evidence) |
| Emergency Temporary Removal from Participation | The Society Seneschal with the approval of the Chairman of the Board after consultation with the Crown and/or Kingdom Seneschal of the applicable Kingdom. | Until the Board reviews the decision and makes a final determination on the Removal | Board of Directors (with new evidence) |
| Revocation of Membership and Denial of Participation | The SCA Inc Board | Permanent | No |

The Crown, the Kingdom Seneschal, the Society Seneschal, and any appointed investigator are prohibited from commenting outside the chain of command on any ongoing sanction or investigation into any matter that may lead to a sanction.

In case of an affiliate group, the SCA Sanction policy still applies, but if the accused member is in an affiliate organisation, then any sanction investigation and subsequent request from the Kingdom Seneschal or Society Seneschal's office goes to the affiliate membership organization head, not SCA Inc. 


## Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should contact the relevant Drachenwald or SCA Inc authority with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. Possibilities for appeal of sanctions are shown in the table above.
