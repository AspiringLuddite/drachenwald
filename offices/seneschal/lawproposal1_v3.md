# Proposed Kingdom Law Changes for a Curia

Their Majesties Æiríkr and Jacquelyna give notice that they intend to hold an online Curia Regis before the end of the year 2020 to review 2 proposed Drachenwald Law changes. The first matter is to have Drachenwald law reflect Corpora regarding the removal of gender requirements for participating in Crown List. The second matter is to make the Drachenwald awards gender neutral and to reorganize sections describing awards to make them more readable.

Note that these proposed changes are being put before the Curia for discussion. The outcome of that discussion may be that any of the proposed changes may be rejected, or altered before being implemented into Kingdom Law.

The date and time of the Curia will be announced on the Kingdom website, by social media and to the Drachenwald email list by mid-October. All Greater Officers of the Kingdom should make every effort to attend this on-line curia. If Greater officers are unable to do so, they may send a designated representative, or make their comments known to the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal in writing, prior to the day of the Curia. Members of the populace may also send comments in writing to the Crown (crown@drachenwald.sca.org) and Kingdom Seneschal (seneschal@drachenwald.sca.org) in advance of the meeting.

# 1 Proposal to change Drachenwald law 7.02.2.1 (September 10)

## Reasoning

The purpose of the proposed change is to have the kingdom law reflect Corpora regarding the removal of gender requirements for participating in Crown List. Additionally the word "Consort" is changed to "consort" for consistency.

Corpora IV.B.1 used to be:

> Each competitor in a Royal List must be fighting for a prospective consort of the opposite sex unless the Crown has elected to permit a competitor to fight for a prospective consort of the same sex.

On 19 October 2019, Corpora IV.B.1 was changed to:

> Each competitor in a Royal List must be fighting for a prospective consort.

## Formatting

In the proposed law text below, added text is marked with **bold** and removed text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~. All other text is unchanged from the current law text.

## Proposed law text

7.02.2.1 Each competitor in the Crown Tournament must be fighting for a prospective **consort.** ~~consort of the opposite sex unless the Crown has elected to permit a competitor to fight for a prospective consort of the same sex.~~ The competitor and prospective **consort** ~~Consort~~ are referred to as "Participants" in these laws.

# 2 Proposal to change Drachenwald law 9-11

The award sections have gone through some reworking to achieve three things.

1. The most important changes acknowledge that the roles of Sovereign and Consort are not gendered although the titles King and Queen are. One important consideration in the proposal has been to not change the existing awards but prepare as much as possible for events that were not considered when the award was created.

   - The Order of the Companions of Albion (11.02) has in fact been registered with the SCA College of Arms without the word "King" in it and won’t need further actions.

   - The Queen's Order of Courtesy of Drachenwald (11.03) is called the Order of Courtesy in the proposed text. The purpose of the award has not changed. As before, it is conferred by Consort.

   - The Sigillum is and has always been awarded either jointly by the Crown or separately by Sovereign or by Consort. The proposed changes in the law text do not change this, nor do they change the symbols of the award variants. The original law text presumes King Sovereign and Queen Consort and fails to address Queen Sovereign, King Consort, and situations where both of the rulers use either King or Queen as their titles. The proposed law recognises the difference between the role (Sovereign and Consort) and the title (King/Queen) of a ruler of the Kingdom, and provides the appropriate award names for the various combinations. The name of the award reflects the title of the one bestowing it (King’s -> Regis; Queen’s -> Reginae). The symbol of the award, however, reflects the role (Sovereign or Consort, or both together). This is the case currently, and is merely clarified in the proposed text. This award was originally created in principality days. When Drachenwald became a kingdom, some other – and potentially more gender-neutral – options were considered but were turned down by the SCA College of Arms. 

2. The second change was to unify the style and way how the awards have been written to the law. The most significant change is related to Ordo Annuli (10.03).

   - A style issue was observed in capitalisation related to awards. In the current law the use has been very mixed even within the same sentence. In the proposed text, "award" or "order" are capitalised as part of the name of an award/order, for example the Order of X. When writing about awards and orders in general, no capitalisation is done unless the word is at the beginning of a sentence.

   - Awards and orders have symbols, but only some of those are registered badges. To avoid confusion the proposed law uses only the word "symbol".

3. The third part of the changes includes correcting the language to use better English as well as some added clarifications to some of the awards.

## Formatting

In the proposed law text below, added text is marked with **bold** and removed text is marked with ~~strikethrough~~. All other text is unchanged from the current law text.
