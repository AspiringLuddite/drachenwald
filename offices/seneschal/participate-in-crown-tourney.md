<h2><a name="law" id="law">Kingdom Law on Crown Tourney</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.02 Concerning the Crown List</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.02.1</strong> The Crown Tournaments of Drachenwald will be held on the first weekend of April and the second weekend of October. If Spring Crown Tournament falls on Easter weekend, the event will be moved to the second weekend of April. No other events may be held on these dates</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2</strong> Requirements for Participation</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.1</strong> Each competitor in the Crown Tournament must be fighting for a prospective consort of the opposite sex unless the Crown has elected to permit a competitor to fight for a prospective consort of the same sex. The competitor and prospective Consort are referred to as "Participants" in these laws</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.2</strong> Participants must be able to fulfill the duties of the Crown as outlined in 2.02</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.3</strong> Participants must be acceptable to the Crown and declare their intent to participate in a letter submitted to the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal 30 days prior to the date scheduled for Crown List. The Participants' letter of intent must include at least:</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.3.1</strong> Proof of membership (as described in Corpora IV.A.2)</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.3.2</strong> Proof of current fighter authorisation for the competitor</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.3.3</strong> The modern and SCA names of the Participants along with their address(es) and other contact information</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.4</strong> Participants must both be present at the Crown Tournament</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.5</strong> Participants must be at least eighteen years old on the day of the Tournament</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.6</strong> The Participants may not be Territorial Coronets, nor the Crown's appointed representatives of a Crown Principality (such as Viceroy and/or Vicereine), at the time of the Crown Lists or at any time during their tenure as successor or Drachenwald Crown</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.7</strong> Each person must be a member of the S.C.A. or any appropriate affiliate organisation, and must have access to the <em>Dragon's Tale</em>. The Victor and Consort must maintain their membership without lapse, throughout Their tenure as Successors and Crowns</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.8</strong> The intent of a residency requirement is to ensure that participants in the Crown List are familiar with Drachenwald culture, traditions, and customs and that they understand the unique aspects of our Kingdom. Therefore the residency requirements for all participants are:</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.8.1</strong> Participants must have resided in Drachenwald for the six months preceding the Crown List entered</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.8.2</strong> Each participant must have attended at least six official events (before Crown Tournament), held in Drachenwald, listed on the Kingdom Calendar in the Dragon's Tale, in the preceding eighteen months. Additionally, each participant must have attended one official event (defined by the same requirements), more than 6 months before Crown Tournament but not more than 24 months before Crown Tournament. This event may be one of the six but does not need to be</p>
<p><strong>7.02.2.8.3</strong> On a case by case basis, if the Sovereign, Consort and Kingdom Seneschal, all agree, the Requirements for Participation in 7.02.2.8.1 and 7.02.2.8.2 may be waived</p>
<p><strong>7.02.3</strong> Each Participant will sign a statement, prior to the tourney, saying that they meet the requirements for membership (as stated in Corpora, part IV) and other requirements as listed above. This statement will be kept by the Seneschal's Office until the end of the Victor's reign</p>
