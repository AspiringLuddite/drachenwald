During this period of time, when the majority of the Kingdoms have enacted Covid-19 precautions, the SCA Board of Directors allows official business meetings (courts, curia, A&S competitions) in Drachenwald to be held on-line. We have set up the following guidelines for you and your groups to follow when you hold on-line meetings. Note: Other on-line gatherings in Drachenwald, such as A&S classes, or general meetings that are not conducting official business are not required to be pre-scheduled or announced. The below guidelines apply only to on-line meetings to conduct official business.

1. All official on-line business meetings must be pre-approved and scheduled with the Kingdom Seneschal prior to them being announced or held. This may be done by sending an email to onlinemeetings@drachenwald.sca.org containing the following information:
    * The title of the meeting or court
    * Date and time
    * Name of the sponsoring group
    * Location (including address) of the event that was cancelled at which this meeting would have taken place (or, if it is a brand-new meeting or event, the address of the host).
    * A short description of what business will be conducted.
2. For an on-line business meeting to be official it must include:
 These individuals must be present on-line and on screen during the course of the entire meeting.
    * At least one of the King, Queen, Prince, Princess, or (landed) Baron/Baroness, as appropriate for the event/meeting
    * Their Seneschal, or their Seneschal’s designate
    * At least one other witness, who is an SCA or affiliate member
3. All official on-line business meetings must be announced via the on-line Kingdom calendar, at least one week prior to their date of occurrence. This can be done by using the Kingdom calendar event form ( https://drachenwald.sca.org/events/calendar-add/ ). The event announcement must include:
    * The title of the meeting or court
    * Date and time
    * The web link needed to join the viewing
4. The event should also be announced to the Drachenwald email list and to relevant Kingdom on-line groups with:
    * The title of the meeting or court
    * Date and time
    * The web link needed to join the viewing
5. Court reports and/or business meeting minutes are still required, just as they are for in-person courts and meetings. However, a copy of these should be sent to the Kingdom Seneschal in addition to the normal submission procedure (e.g. by the Herald in charge of the court).

Additional information:

We recommend that the on-line venue have the capability to record the session so that these recordings may be posted on-line for later viewing by all of the people of Drachenwald.
