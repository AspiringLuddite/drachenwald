# Introduction

Drachenwald Law Council is currently reviewing this section of the law to consider if it needs any changes, and if so, exactly what changes they should be. Therefore we are asking you to take a moment to read this and share your thoughts via the provided form.

We would appreciate your comments on this subject; no later than 31 August.

## Reasoning behind this section of the law

The law seeks to ensure that every participant in Crown Tournament is up to date with what is going on in the Kingdom, and has had the chance to become familiar with different areas and groups of Kingdom. Therefore, it sets a requirement for both a minimum number of events attended by all Crown Tournament entrants, as well as a time frame within which they must have attended those events.

Please note that this is a requirement that Crown may waive, allowing Crown Tournament participants who have attended less events.

## Purpose of the review

Some people have found the law text unclear regarding the number of events needed as well as the time frame for when the events happened. This review does not intend to remove the requirement of event attendance, but to determine whether it is necessary to clarify it.

# Current law text

> 7.02.2.8.2 Each participant must have attended at least six official events (before Crown Tournament), held in Drachenwald, listed on the Kingdom Calendar in the Dragon's Tale, in the preceding eighteen months. Additionally, each participant must have attended one official event (defined by the same requirements), more than 6 months before Crown Tournament but not more than 24 months before Crown Tournament. This event may be one of the six but does not need to be.

## Examples of possible changes

### Current law without changes

* Each participant to Crown Tournament must have attended at least 6 events within the preceding 18 months.
* At least 1 event must have taken place 6-24 months before the Crown Tournament. This event may be one of the above mentioned six but does not need to be.

### Example law change 1

* Each participant to Crown Tournament must have attended at least 4 events within the preceding 18 months.

### Example law change 2

* Each participant to Crown Tournament must have attended at least 6 events within the preceding 18 months.

* One of the events must have taken place within six months of the Crown Tournament.
* One of the events must have taken place between 6 and 24 months before the Crown Tournament.
