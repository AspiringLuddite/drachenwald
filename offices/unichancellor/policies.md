<h3>2. The Annual Royal Artisan Competition of the Kingdom of Drachenwald</h3>
<h4>2.1. Overall explanation</h4>
<p>The Royal Artisan Competition is held to select the Crown’s Royal Artisan. &nbsp;It shall be held in multiple stages throughout the year at the following events: &nbsp;Twelfth Night/Midwinter Coronation, &nbsp;Spring Crown Tournament, Midsummer Coronation, and Fall Crown Tourney. These events will be referred to as Competition Events throughout this document. The cycle will begin at Twelfth Night and conclude at Fall Crown, where the winners will be announced. &nbsp;The Royal Artisan will then be invested in a formal ceremony at Kingdom University. The competitions are drawn from six general A&amp;S categories (culinary arts, fine arts, sciences, textile arts, performance arts, and research). Additionally, prizes will be awarded in two special categories (under the age of 12 and between the ages of 12 and 16). Each general category is broken into the subcategories.</p>
<h4>2.2. The Royal Artisan and Nobiles Officinae</h4>
<p>The Nobiles Oficinae are the royal workshops of the Kingdom of Drachenwald. This is a body of former royal artisans, termed "Court Artisans", whose job is to assist the Crown with Their artisanal/artistic needs. The Nobiles Oficinae is headed by the Royal Artisan, who shall be act as the Crown’s artistic arm. They shall be the point of contact for the Crown in all matters artisanal. The Royal Artisan shall not, however be required to do the actual work his or herself, but may employ anyone, whether a subject of Drachenwald or not, to complete a royal commission. If the Crown requires banners, for example, They shall turn to the Royal Artisan, who will then utilize the Court Artisans, or anyone else appropriate.</p>
<h5>2.2.1 Prizes and Judging</h5>
<p>The overall winner of each Competition Event will be announced either in court or at feast and will receive an additional 5 points towards their score for the Royal Artisan competition. At Kingdom University (not a Competition Event), &nbsp;a prize will be awarded for each regular category and each special category. The winner for each category will be the individual with the most points in that category throughout the year. The winners will be presented with a token of acknowledgement.</p>
<p>If the entrants are present, they may request either face-to-face judging or a conventional judging without the presence of the entrant. Judges are required to sign their names on the judging sheets, and are asked to provide written commentary about the entry. All judging sheets are returned to the representative of the Kingdom MoAS in charge of the Competition event. We consider judging forms to be private, so they will be returned directly to the entrant, and are not available for perusal by other entrants or by the populace. Judging forms shall be returned to the entrants after the scores have been tallied, on the same day as the competition.</p>
<p>A minimum of two judges shall be found for each entry. Judges may compete in the Royal Artisan Competition as well, but may not enter items at the same Competition Event at which they are judging, nor may they enter items in categories in which they have judged during that competition cycle.</p>
<p>We will make every effort to find judges who are knowledgeable about the particular topic of the competition, but we are limited to those individuals present at the event and available at the time of the competition.</p>
<h5>2.2.2. Categories</h5>
<p>The competitions are drawn from six general A&amp;S categories (culinary arts, fine arts, sciences, textile arts, performance arts, and research). Each of these categories are divided into subcategories.</p>
<p><strong>Special Categories&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The special categories have some special requirements and rules. You need to fulfill the requirements if you want to enter into one of the special categories. For requirements and rules, please see the information below. At the end of the year, one prize will be awarded for the best item from each of these special categories. These categories are separate from the Royal Artisan Competition, and any item entered in them will not be considered for that competition.</p>
<p><strong>Under 12 Category</strong></p>
<p>May enter with items from all subcategories from above. You need to be younger than 12 years old at the day of the competition to enter this category. The item should be entered with a small amount of documentation that includes: SCA name, modern name, name of item, country of origin, period of origin and if the item is made with or without help. The important part is the item and not the documentation.</p>

<li>You must have completed the item you enter into the competition while residing in the Kingdom.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may not enter the same item multiple times within the same year's competition.</li>

<li>You must send a letter of intent to the Kingdom MoAS (at least two weeks in advance of the Competition event, via e-mail ( <script type="text/javascript">document.write(String.fromCharCode(60,97,32,104,114,101,102,61,39,109,97,105,108,116,111,58,109,111,97,115,64,100,114,97,99,104,101,110,119,97,108,100,46,115,99,97,46,111,114,103,39,62,109,111,97,115,64,100,114,97,99,104,101,110,119,97,108,100,46,115,99,97,46,111,114,103,60,47,97,62));</script>)) containing &nbsp;your SCA and mundane names, the number of items you plan to enter, a brief description of each item, and the category into which the item will be entered.</li>
<li>You can also enter as many items as you like, but each item needs to be entered with its own documentation. </li>
<li>You may have more than one item for each entry, but in that case it will be counted as a single entry with your documentation. This might be a way to show a special technique (like the different stages of making a gauntlet) or to better illustrate a complex manufacturing process.</li>
<li>You cannot enter an item more than once by itself. But you can incorporate an already entered item as part of a larger project at a later occasion. If you include it as part of a larger project, the item must be specifically identified in your documentation.</li>

<li>Individuals may enter any category they wish, and enter as many items as they like in each category. However, only your highest scoring item from a given category will be used to determine the Royal Artisan. In other words, if you enter three different meads as separate items, the highest score of the three will be used as your score for the Culinary Arts category.</li>
<li>All items must be entered by Saturday morning. To become the Royal Artisan, you must enter at least two different events, and enter in at least three different categories, scoring at least 50 points on each.</li>
