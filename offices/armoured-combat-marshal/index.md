excerpt: "Full speed, full-contact combat in armour, with rattan weapons: aspiring to chivalry"

Points for combat page

- the first event of our Society, the party in the backyard, was a tournament. 
- emulating the chivalric tournaments of high middle ages, aspiring to connect w/ some spirit of chivalry

- combat has developed into full-speed, and full-contact martial art
- full speed - not telegraphed as in reenactment
- full contact - not 'pulled' as in LaRP and in reenactment
- tournament and melee outcomes are decided on the field - unlike in reenactment, noone knows who will win the tournament of the day, or lead the winning side in chivalric tourney
- blows decided on honour system - the person receiving them determines whether they suffice to be an injury or fatal

- our focus is on safety first, and capacity to take part, over excellence, while everyone still aspires to improve. Taking part, fighting for the honour of a friend or loved one, is as welcomed as brilliant feats of prowess

- people of any size and gender, after age 16 (UK and Europe) can train and authorise
- combat has some base requirements for physical capacity - but many people take part who might not in other fields. SCA fighters include those in wheelchairs, and amputees
