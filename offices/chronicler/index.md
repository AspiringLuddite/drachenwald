1. Submit your event through the [form]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/calendar-add.html %})
2. Make sure all required information has been submitted through the form before the deadline. You will receive an email the day after you submit the form with your deadline and other information. If you did not receive this email after 2 days, contact webminister@drachenwald.sca.org.  Information submitted to the form is copied to the chronicler automatically
3. Check if your event shows as 'official' or 'published' on the [online calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/calendar/index.md %}) or that it has been published in the Dragons Tale.
