<p>Here you will find information about the office of the Kingdom Chronicler and the Kingdom newsletter - the Dragon's Tale; how to write for the newsletter; how to use the Kingdom Calendar and write announcements; and guidelines for local chroniclers.</p>

<p>Update 2016-05-27<br />There are new ways of reading <em>Dragon's Tale online</em>.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://members.sca.org/apps/#Newsletters" target="_blank">https://members.sca.org/apps/#Newsletters</a> and log in with the same login information that you use to renew your membership.</p>

<p>If you are member of an affiliation (for example Nordmark or Aarnimets√§) and don't have an SCA inc membership number you should log in with the username "affiliate" (all lowercase) and password "affiliate" (also all lowercase). There is even an option to "remember me on this computer", so you don't have to enter in your login information each time! The nuances of logging in are on the left side of the screen, including methods for getting help.

<p>Once you are logged in: at the top of the screen are the membership options. Click the button for newsletter access on the far right. This will open the directory of Kingdoms. Note that on the directory of Kingdoms, there is a folder marked Archives. This is where the older issues of the electronic newsletters are maintained. These files currently go back to March 2012 when we first introduced electronic newsletters.</p>

<p>If you have any difficulties or questions, please email <script type="text/javascript">document.write(String.fromCharCode(60,97,32,104,114,101,102,61,39,109,97,105,108,116,111,58,109,101,109,98,101,114,115,104,105,112,64,115,99,97,46,111,114,103,39,62,109,101,109,98,101,114,115,104,105,112,64,115,99,97,46,111,114,103,60,47,97,62));</script>. Include your modern name, membership number, and a brief explanation of the problem you're experiencing.</p>
