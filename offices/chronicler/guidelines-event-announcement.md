Event announcements are the formal method of notifying the populace of events that are scheduled on the Kingdom Calendar. It also make the event "<a href="/content/making-your-event-official">official</a>" for the purpose of Kingdom business . If the event is not on the Kingdom Calendar then an event announcement is not needed (except maybe in your local newsletter).

# Schedule Your Event

Your event must be scheduled on the Kingdom Calendar before submitting your event announcement. Events are scheduled using the [Drachenwald event registration form]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/calendar-add.html %}). You should wait until you receive confirmation that the date is accepted before sending the announcement.

Your announcement must appear in the issue of <em>Dragon's Tale</em> for the month the event occurs. If the event is in the first 10 days or so, then it should appear the previous month as well. 

Dragon's Tale policy is that event announcements for this month and next month will always appear in the current issue. Announcements for events further in the future may appear, subject to space available, with priority being given to Kingdom events. To ensure advance notice of an event, a mini-announcement may be submitted. See <a href="#mini">below</a> for an example. 

# Writing Your Announcement

Event announcements should be kept simple and to the point. They should contain sufficient information to help people decide if they want to attend or not. The information listed below must be included. Detailed driving directions, timetables of events etc are best left to an event website, or to be emailed to those reserving for the event. Announcements will be edited to standardise content and length. An example announcement is shown
at the bottom of the page.

Announcements should be sent in plain, unformatted Word or RTF format, preferably sent as an email attachment. Be wary of accented characters, which do not always transfer well in email or plain text. Do not send elaborately laid out flyers, as these make it much harder to edit the copy into the newsletter, and anyway, the formatting won't be used anyway.

Before submitting your announcement, please check to ensure you have included all the required elements listed below.

Send the announcements to the Chronicler using the <script type="text/javascript">document.write(String.fromCharCode(60,97,32,104,114,101,102,61,39,109,97,105,108,116,111,58,99,104,114,111,110,105,99,108,101,114,64,100,114,97,99,104,101,110,119,97,108,100,46,115,99,97,46,111,114,103,39,62,99,104,114,111,110,105,99,108,101,114,64,100,114,97,99,104,101,110,119,97,108,100,46,115,99,97,46,111,114,103,60,47,97,62));</script> address. Mark your announcement with "[DT] Name of Event" in the subject.

The deadline for event announcements is the 25th of the month, two months before the issue date, e.g. the deadline for the December issue is 25th October.
