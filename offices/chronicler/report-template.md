title: Chronicler report templte

<p>All local and regional Chroniclers should provide a quarterly report.&nbsp; The report should contain all of the information listed below, plus any other information that is relevant.</p>
<p>Chroniclers in affiliate organisations should still submit reports, but do not need to include financial information.</p>
<p>The reports are due at the standard Kingdom deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Quarter - 25 April</li>
<li>2nd Quarter - 25 July</li>
<li>3rd Quarter - 25 October</li>
<li>4th Quarter - 25 January (Domesday report)</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you don't report your newsletter's finances monthly, you have the option to do a full year financial report to the Chronicler when Domesday report is due. All groups, even the ones that report finances during the year, have to provide the Kingdom Chronicler with a yearly financial report!</p>
