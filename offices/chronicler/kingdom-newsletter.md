# The Dragon's Tale
The _Dragon's Tale_ is the official kingdom newsletter of the Kingdom of Drachenwald and is published monthly, available online and by post to subscribing members.
The newsletter is the official source for all Kingdom business, such as

* changes to law
* Royal proclamations
* communications from the Crown and Kingdom Officers 
* event announcements 

It also contains the official contact list for Kingdom Officers and local seneschals.
In addition to the above, the newsletter also publishes court reports, the results of heraldic submissions and articles on matters of interest to SCA folk.
