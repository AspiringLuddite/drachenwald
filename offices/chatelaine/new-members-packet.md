title: Help your group accept new members
---
<p>This is a very important part of the Chatelain's job. If the new people<br />
        are not accepted, hey probably will not stay in the group. Here are a few<br />
        ideas on helping your group to accept new members:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a populace meeting before recruiting, and make sure the populace<br />
          is willing to help the new people. Encourage everyone to talk to the new<br />
          people.</li>
<li>Print up a range of suggestions for established members on how to help<br />
          newcomers stick around. Include ideas such as:<br />
          - If you see someone you do not know, go up and say HELLO!<br />
          - Introduce the new person to other people.<br />
          - Offer to explain what is going on.
<p>          - Find out what the new person is interested in.<br />
          - Help the person get involved.</p></li>
<li>Ask for volunteers to be "buddies" to the new people for a little<br />
          while.</li>
<li>Once new people arrive, plan activities that will encourage the<br />
          interaction of the old and new members.</li>
<li>Put up a written introduction in the local newsletter, to introduce<br />
          the new person to the populace. Also include some contact information<br />
          (remember to get permission of the new person first). This gives the<br />
          populace an extra connection with the new person.</li>
<li>Ask established members what helped them to feel welcome when they<br />
          were new to the SCA. This may give you ideas, and it helps remind the<br />
          established members what it is like to be new.<br />
          Retaining new members cannot be a one person job. Simply talking about it<br />
          may help the populace to realise how important it is to make the new<br />
          people feel welcome.</li>
