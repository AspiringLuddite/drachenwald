title: Reporting guidelines for Chatelaines
---
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Kingdom Chatelaine must report every quarter to the Society Chatelaine and the Kingdom Seneschal as detailed in the Kingdom of Drachenwald Great Book of Laws section 5.03.5 and 5.03.7.2. To make that report accurately for the entire Kingdom the Kingdom Chatelaine needs to have reports from the Regional Chatelaines who in turn collect information from the Local Branch Chatelaines.</p>
<p><b>5.03.5</b> All Great Officers will submit to the Crown and the Kingdom Seneschal a copy of any official reports forwarded to their corresponding Society Officer. If a Great Officer does not submit reports to their corresponding Society Officer at least once a quarter, then, as a minimum, will submit a written report to the Crown two weeks prior to Coronation and Crown Tournament. </p>
<p><b>5.03.7.2</b> Standard quarters will be used for reporting purposes within Drachenwald. These quarters are January through March, April through June, July through September, and October through December. Quarterly reports due to Kingdom Great Officers will have standard deadlines of 25 April (for the first quarter), 25 July (for the second quarter), 25 October (for the third quarter), and 25 January (for the last quarter and annual summary). Kingdom officers who require only semi-annual reports will use the January and July deadline for their reporting requirements.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>
<h3>Reporting schedule</h3>
Chatelaines are to report quarterly and submit an annual summary called the Doomsday report at the end of the year. Standard quarters are used in reporting, as it is stated in the Kingdom Law.

The Kingdom Chatelaine must submit the report to the Kingdom Seneschal by the 25th: April, July, October and January (Domesday Report) and therefore needs to have the Regional Chatelaine reports by the 15th of the relevant month. In turn the Local Branch Chatelaines reports need to be with the Regionals by 5th of the relevant month.

Regional Chatelaines send their reports to the Kingdom Chatelaine via email. The address is chatelaine@drachenwald.sca.org. 
Regional Chatelaines who are responsible for Principalities or Crown Principalities should also send a copy of their reports to the Seneschal of their region.

<h3>Requirement to Report and warrants</h3>
Warranted Chatelaines are required to report quarterly and any Chatelaine who misses two consecutive reports in a twelve month period is deemed to have resigned.
Chatelaines-at-Large are not required to report quarterly but should keep in contact with the Kingdom Chatelaine and advise them of their activities when appropriate.
Regional chatelaines require a warrant. They are warranted after submitting their first quarterly report.
