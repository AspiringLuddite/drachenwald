title: Kingdom Herald
excerpt: Heralds bring alive the pageantry of the medieval era
---

Heralds in the Middle Ages were specialists in chivalry, tournaments, coats-of-arms and the technicalities of war.  Heralds in the Society are experts in communicating tournament combat, court ceremony, and the specifics of historical names and coats-of-arms.

Heralds bring pageantry to the Society: we help make a modern experience turn into a near-medieval one. We do this in several ways.
