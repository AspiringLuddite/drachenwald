# Part I Introduction

The Drachenwald Book of Ceremonies was originally compiled by Mistress Adelaide de Beaumont, then Schwarzdrachen Herald, as a part of the project of Drachenwald becoming a Kingdom. Ten years later, Marcus and Anna, then Crown Prince and Princess, commissioned a revision of the ceremony and oaths for their coronation, and this led to an updated Second Edition of the entire book. A third edition was produced when the Order of Defence became a fourth order of bestowed peerage.

This fourth edition has been created for a couple of reasons. The first is to include the new grant level awards of the Orders of the Ring. The second is to take into account that a ruling couple may no longer be one man and one woman, but two of the same or that they or a recipient/candidate may not consider themselves as either.

While new editions of the Book of Ceremonies have only been published once a decade, one should keep in mind that a book like this is by its nature a work in progress: new ceremonies appear and old ones are changed as needed. However, most changes that happen over the years are minor, and this is as it should be. Ceremonies are one of the fundamental aspects of this Society, and while it is possible to change them, this should be done slowly and with reverence.

Nevertheless, while the standard ceremonies change relatively little over time, there is room for alternate ceremonies and oaths. There is a companion volume to this Book that includes such additional material; more would be welcome.

In terms of practical heralding, it is also permitted to drop parts of ceremonies where this may prove advantageous. When you are aware that a court will be long, you will do yourself and the Crown more favour by being as succinct as possible rather than reading the introduction to each and every order or award being presented.

In service,

Nicholas de Estleche dictus le Tardif, Schwarzdrachen

## Version History

* First edition: 1993, ed. by Adelaide de Beaumont
* Second edition: 2004, ed. by Pietari Uv
* Third edition: 2017, ed. by Pietari Uv
* Fourth edition: 2021, ed. by Nicholas de Estleche

# Part II Advice for their Majesties
* The court is where you truly become the embodiment of Drachenwald. Here is where you project the Kingdom as you wish it to be, where you make the Kingdom as you wish it to be. The words you speak here become the reality of Drachenwald, whether that be the Law, the raising of those deserving reward or the declaration of war and peace. Your decisions will be made elsewhere, but here is where they become substance. This will be someone's first experience of Drachenwald ceremony, it will be their first recognition for their service or skills and it will be where they are celebrated for their accomplishments.
* Your herald is not just your messenger. When they wear your tabard, they don't just speak for you, they speak **as** you. They are how you project your voice and command before recording devices. Your herald is inviolable, as are the heralds of others. As your herald is treated by others, so are you, and vice versa.
* Unless you have been a herald previously, there will be much unfamiliar about the process and running of courts. Your herald can guide you.
* When speaking with the intent to be heard by more than just an individual, speak louder and slower than you would normally. One of the most frustrating things as an attendee of court is being unable to hear the business being enacted. Your herald speaks as you, so can take the load, or conversely you may wish to speak in person more than is the guide in this book.
* Know the space in which you will be presiding. This applies to such things as obstacles, compactness, acoustics, light levels, etc.
* Be aware of the state of those being called before you you. For some, even a joyful reward can be a stressful experience when singled out in public. There is no requirement that an award be a surprise. Some people enjoy that, some would prefer to be prepared. A summons to court, in as much detail as you think warranted, can be a good option for the latter.
* A specific case of the previous point are newcomers. They will be at their first event, know very few people, most likely still be uncomfortable in their clothes and completely unfamiliar with what to do in court. Surprise is just extra stress and they should be called up after they have had a chance to see how more experienced members approach.
* Courts can be as formal or informal as you desire, and can have different priorities. For example, it may be that rewarding a fighter at the castle gates prior to the assault may be more meaningful than in a formal court. The trade off is that fewer people will be witness.
* Try to avoid long courts: they are not popular, if sometimes necessary. If a court must be long consider building in a break or give permission for people to come and go. Much of the formality of awards and orders will be generally well known, and can be dispensed with when time is at a premium.
* Prepare as much of the court business as far ahead of the event as possible. Know who your herald will be and involve them. It is inevitable that you will not have anywhere near as much spare time at an event as you think. You will have meetings, consultations, tournaments, displays and waylayers. Time to prepare an entire court on the day will be very restricted.

# Part III Advice for Heralds
* When you wear their Majesties' tabard, you do more than just represent them, you speak **as** them. What you do reflects directly upon them. You should act as they would. Remember however, that when their Majesties ask you to do something in their name, you are their voice. It can sometimes be daunting to ask, or even instruct, those who would normally be of higher rank and experience within the Society than you. As their Majesties herald, though, you act with their authority.
* Advise their Majesties honestly, on tradition, on what is period, on how best to accomplish something. In the end though, the final decision is theirs.
* Know the space in which you will be presiding. This applies to such things as obstacles, compactness, acoustics, light levels, etc.
* You do not have to do everything within court yourself. Delegate to others. Small jobs, such as the reading of a scroll, can be good starting points for those wishing to gain experience in the business of court heraldry.
* Make sure the court has the physical items necessary. Tables, not just for royalty, but for business items and your drink. Chairs not just for their Majesties, but also for any with business in court who are infirm. A chair is also often appreciated by those receiving a peerage as it is a long ceremony and one they should enjoy rather than getting sore knees.
* Receiving an award is often an emotional experience. Give the recipient time to take it in.
* As far as possible make sure newcomers know that they will be called up and know what to do. Ideally they should be called after they’ve had a chance to observe more experienced members. They will be unsure and unfamiliar, amongst people they don’t know.
* Always place a drink for yourself in the court before it starts.
* **Vivat** is for one person, **vivant** for more than one.

# Part IV Business Checklist

This is not a mandatory list, but considering each item for inclusion will help ensure all potential business has been considered. Different items can be intertwined.

* Awards and Orders (usually ordered with lowest precedence first, but be flexible). A peerage is usually the last piece of business of a court, whether that be invocation or elevation.
* Children.
* Those for whom it is their first court [in Drachenwald] (near the end of court).
* The business of other royalty present.
* Guild business.
* Tournaments and competition proclamations and results.
* Event Steward & staff.
* Head Cook & staff.
* Oaths of Fealty (peerages, officers, personal).
* Inductions into positions of fealty or office.
* Interludes (music, poetry, stories, etc.). Not a good idea in already long courts.
* Ambassadors
* Anyone who has requested time for other business.

# Part V Physical Layout

* Not all courts have to involved the Sovereigns in being seated. These can be far more fluid in conduct and set up. for a more formal court:
* Placing the entire retinue behind the thrones is to be discouraged.
* The herald should be in position to move freely: to centre stage as voice, into the background, to interact with the Sovereigns and to guide those called into the royal presence.
* Guards and champions should be where they can physically do their job.
* Attendants need easy access to provide drinks, refills, snacks and paraphenalia to the Sovereigns.
* An ideal court would have a chronicler, although this has been rarely done. If you know something complicated or freestyle may occur, a chronicler is recommended. They will need a table and chair.
* The Sovereigns will need a table for their drinks and stuff. A table will be needed for tokens and other objects to be held until they are needed. The herald should have a table for a drink and other items required for court.
* There should be corridors to allow the nobles access to their Sovereigns as commanded. If the Sovereigns intend to process in ot out, make sure that corridor is large enough for the retinue.
* You will need enough space for those called forwards. If this is likely to be a large number, such as prior to a vigil or for an elevation, take this into account.
* A stool and/or cushon should be provided for kneeling in front of the Sovereigns. Keep a spare chair handy for any who may be unable to kneel. A chair is also handy for elevation ceremonies for the candidate, however fit.
* Other royalty invited to attend in state should be arranged from the Sovereigns, those cloest being higher in precedence. Remember that those who rule the lands for their Majesties, such as Princes or Barons, jump up the order in their own lands.
* Ideally the peerage should be sat closest to the Sovereigns, either in the front rows or in choirs to the side. Peers are as easy to herd as cats, so this will rarely be achieved to perfection.

# Part VI Royalty

For distinction, the Crown who is monarch by right of arms is called Sovereign, their inspiration is called Consort.

## 1. Invocation to the Crown Lists

Herald
: Their Royal Majesties command the presence of all entrants in the Crown Lists, that they should present themselves and their consorts before the Crown.

: _Couples approach the thrones one at a time, exchange a few words with the Crown, receive usually some token of the day, withdraw slightly and kneel._

Herald
: My Lords and Ladies, you know well that true gentles enter combat not for their own personal glory, but rather to advance the honour of their consorts; and to prove, by their courtesy and valour upon the field, their worthiness of that honour.

: Be mindful, as you fight, of your consort's honour as well as your own, for your consort personifies all honour and loyalty, beauty and truth – they embody the love that is worthy of great reward.

: Therefore, today you fight in the Crown Lists not to gain power for yourself, not for your own glory and honour, as you may in other lists. You fight instead for the honour and glory of the one whose favour you bear upon the field, whom you would advance by your valour, skill and courtesy.

: And should victory be granted to you this day, you will be crowned together as the Heirs of Drachenwald, until the day of your coronation shall come.

Sovereign
: You have heard the reasons for our lists. Each of you here today has an inspiration whose favour you would advance, whom you would crown this day as your consort. Is it still your desire to participate in these lists?

Entrants
: It is.

Consort
: Do each of you, entrant and consort, now affirm that you, fulfil all the qualifications for fighting today as set forth by our laws?

Entrants and Consorts
: I do.

Sovereign
: And do you all here know the Rules of the Lists and swear to abide them?

Entrants
: I do.

Consort
: Then bear your favours bravely into battle, and prove the worth and virtue of your consorts, whether in victory or in honourable defeat. You have our leave to withdraw and prepare.

## 2. Investiture of the Heirs

Herald
: ____________ , given victory this day upon the field of honour, Their Majesties command you to present yourself and your Consort ____________ before the thrones.

: _Victor and Inspiration come forward, bow and kneel. The Crowns rise. Courtiers with the Coronets come forward from the Royal entourage, bow before the Crowns and kneel beside Victor and Inspiration. The Crowns take the Coronets from the cushions. Courtiers remain kneeling._

Sovereign
: ____________ , by your valour and skill, you have most nobly advanced the honour of your Inspiration and won yourself a high estate. I do hereby acknowledge your right to succeed to these our lands.

Consort
: And you, ____________ , by your grace and virtue you have inspired your champion to victory. I do hereby acknowledge your right to succeed to these our lands.

: _The Crowns hold the Coronets high above the heads of the victor and the inspiration and crown them, while they speak the following words._

Sovereign & Consort
: Be thou Crown Prince / Princess of Drachenwald.

: _The Crowns raise the Heirs, whilst the herald speaks the following words._

# Part VIII Peerage Orders
## 1. Order of Chivalry

*** Invocation of the Vigil ****

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of Chivalry.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: __________, your skill with arms is known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of Chivalry.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Chivalry
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of Peerage and Chivalry. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that, but further, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oath you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Pelican:_

The Order of the Pelican is the order of Service, and yet, a Knight and a Master of Arms must serve as well: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each member of the Chivalry performing to the best of their ability, and then to that point of performance where sacrifice is required. A Peer must be willing to do good works, and must do then more frequently and more extensively than their friends who are not Peers.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Laurel:_

The Order of the Laurel is the order of the Arts and Sciences, but a Knight and a Master of Arms must also encourage the Arts and Sciences, not just by appreciating them, but by participating in their practice, for what the strong arm of the warrior wins may be made barren and cold by the battle; only the warm heart can nurture the land and its people and bring them to their fullest potential.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Defence:_

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons, but a Knight and a Master of Arms must be equally skilled in diverse arts martial, either on a tourney field or in war, always striving to become more skilled in the arts and practice them with grace, and to teach those willing to learn.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Chivalry_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, and as such, they stand as the foremost examples of gentle behaviour, valour, and honour. A member of this Order must display equal grace in victory and in defeat; he must not suffer injustice, but neither should he seek vengeance; he must remember that as his reputation depends upon his skill in delivering blows, so it also depends upon the way in which he receives them. Be mindful that a Peer guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others. Continue to live by the Code of Chivalry: to protect the weak and defenceless; to respect and defend the honour of ladies; and to teach these values to others that may seek the true standard of Chivalry. The Code is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest member of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider 	our offer and please give them your guidance and counsel in this matter.

*** Induction into the Order of Chivalry ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Chivalry.

_Members of the Order assemble._

Herald
: Since ancient times it has been recognised that there are certain warriors who are much deserving of high honour, not only by their skill at arms, but by their noble behaviour, which has come to define the meaning of Chivalry.

Therefore was created the Order of the Chivalry, to recognise those who, possessing all the other skills, virtues and attributes appropriate to members of the Peerage, shall also have distinguished themselves by their prowess in armoured combat and chivalrous demeanour. The Order consists of two equal parts, Knights and Masters of Arms.

And the symbols of Knighthood are a white belt and an unadorned chain, while the symbol of Mastery of Arms is a white baldric. The white belt and baldric betoken the honour with which the knight or master girds himself, and the chain the fealty the knight swears. And this Order ranks in precedence with the Orders of the Laurel, the Pelican, and Defence. It carries with it a Patent of Arms.

Escort
: Your Majesties, having consulted with the Order, is it your desire to increase our numbers at this time?

Monarch
: It is. Please bring the candidate forward.

_Escort brings candidate forward._

Escort
: My liege, it is my privilege to present you ____________ , that they may be made a member of our order.

_At this point it is possible to have members of the peerage orders to speak for the candidate:_

Herald
: Not only the arts of Ssordmanship and eye of measure but also the strength of arm and chivalry of heart make one a true warrior. Order of Chivalry stands as primary of these attributes.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Chivalry to speak for the candidate?

Knight / Master of Arms
: _Speaks about the chivalry and prowess in arms of the candidate._

Herald
: But whilst Force of Arms may defend a Realm, it does not make it flourish. Without the Arts and Sciences, the land is bare and barren. The Order of the Laurel is the Order of the Arts and Sciences. But to appreciate what they fight for, a member of the Chivalry must have knowledge of the Arts and Sciences.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Laurel to speak for the candidate?

Laurel
: _Speaks of the candidate in respect to their accomplishments in / appreciation of arts and sciences._

Herald
: No matter the greatness of the Warrior or the Artisan, without Service, they remain isolated, shared not with the Realm. The Order of the Pelican is the Order of Service, but a member of the Chivalry must also serve the Crown and the Realm.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Pelican to speak for the candidate?

Pelican
: _Speaks of the service done by the candidate._

Herald
: By all manner of arms and combat the Kingdom is defended and championed. While the Order of Defence is the Order of Steel, Swordsmanship and Art of Arms, a member of the Chivalry is also a keen student and teacher of these arts.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of Defence to speak for the candidate?

Defence
: _Speaks of the candidate’s long dedication, skill and inspiration in the arts of combat and of his grace in field and court_

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Rose to speak for the candidate?

Herald
: A warrior may be mighty, but without courtesy and honour they are no Peer. The Order of the Rose speaks for courtesy and honour.

Rose
: _Speaks of the courtesy of the candidate._

Herald
: Drachenwald has many Peers, but many more who are not Peers, and their voice is mighty, to be ignored at the peril of all! Is there a message from the People of the Realm in regard to this candidate?

**Representative of the populace
: _Speaks of the largesse, humility or fairness the candidate exhibits in how he interacts with the rest of the society._

_Crown turns to the sponsor._

Monarch
: Do you, Sir/M___ ____________ , and the other members of your order affirm their worthiness for this high honour, accepting them as your peer in chivalry, honour and valour upon the field?

Knights
: I do.

Monarch
: It is our judgement that the candidate fulfils all the requirements of the Order of Chivalry.

Monarch

Candidate
: I will, Your Majesty.

Monarch
: Do you wish us to create you a Knight, and swear fealty to us, or would you rather become a M___ of Arms?

Candidate
: ____________

Monarch
: Make known Our Royal will.

_Herald reads scroll, hands it to Monarch. Monarch hands it to candidate._

*** **In case the candidate opts for Knighthood ***
: Monarch
: Let the candidate's sword be brought forward.

_The candidate' sponsor girds the candidate with the sword belt. During this, the Crown adds the following words._

Monarch
: Remain forever worthy of this sword ____________ , and bear in mind that a sword has two edges, Justice and Mercy.

Monarch
: Let the candidate be vested with his spurs.

_A member of the Chivalry puts the spurs on the candidate._

Herald
: Be mindful that a knight guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others. Continue to live by the Code of Chivalry: protect the weak and defenceless, respect and defend the honour of ladies and teach these values to others that may seek the true standard of knighthood.

Monarch
: With what sword do you wish to be knighted?

_Candidate answers, e.g. Sword of State, Sponsor's sword, etc.. Monarch receives the named sword and if the Crown is not a knight, the sponsor moves around to the right of the throne and lays his hand over the Crown’s. The candidate is struck with the flat side, once on the right shoulder, once on the left and then once on the top of head. During this, a Crown says the following._

Monarch
: I dub thee once, I dub thee twice, I name thee Knight!

_Pause._

Sir ____________ , let this be the last blow you receive without giving answer.

_Crown delivers the buffet, preferably to the right shoulder, firmly but not injuriously. The buffet may be left out completely if the candidate has strong hesitations. The other Crown, if present, receives the white belt and girds the knight with it._

Monarch
: Wear this belt, Sir ____________ , and keep it as you would your honour, unblemished and unstained.

_Crown receives Sword of State. Knight places his hands on the sword, The Crowns place their hands upon knight's hands._

Herald

Sovereign

_Crown receives chain. Crown hangs chain around knights neck, as they say the following._

: Monarch
: Let the candidate's sword be brought forward.

_The candidate' sponsor girds the candidate with the sword belt. During this, the Crown adds the following words._

Monarch
: Remain forever worthy of this sword ____________ , and bear in mind that a sword has two edges, Justice and Mercy.

Monarch
: Let the candidate be vested with his spurs.

_A member of the Chivalry puts the spurs on the candidate._

Herald
: Be mindful that a Master of Arms guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others. Continue to live by the Code of Chivalry: protect the weak and defenceless, respect and defend the honour of ladies and teach these values to others that may seek the true standard of Chivalry.

_Crown receives the white baldric and girds the m___ with it._

Monarch

### 2 Order of the Laurel

*** Invocation of the Vigil ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of the Laurel.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst Our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: __________, your skill in the arts and sciences is known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of the Laurel.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Laurel
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of the Peerage. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that, but more, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oath you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Chivalry:_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, but no less chivalrous behaviour will be expected of you. As a Peer of the Realm you must endeavour to live, as you have until now, by the rules of courtesy and gentle behaviour. This courtly ideal is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Defence:_

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons, but you too are expected to apply to your own art and scholarship with tenacity and grace, to defend what is right, and to share your knowledge with those willing to learn.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Pelican:_

The Order of the Pelican is the order of Service, but each Master and Mistress of the Laurel, too, has the responsibility to serve: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each Laurel performing to the best of their ability, and then to that point of performance where sacrifice is required. A Peer must be willing to do good works, and must do then more frequently and more extensively than their friends who are not Peers.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Laurel._

The Order of the Laurel is the Order most noted for artistry and scholarship. Members of the Orders of Chivalry, Pelican, and Defence, as Peers of the Realm, are expected to have some measure of artistic talent or skill, but a Laurel exemplifies this talent to a degree far greater than that of the other Peers, and greater still than that of the populace at large. Rightly or wrongly, a Laurel is taken as an authority, whose words carry considerable weight; do not therefore choose your words lightly. Remember that just as your praise can encourage a young artisan beyond any other force, your censure can crush a budding talent of which the land may, by your actions, forever be deprived.

To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider 	our offer and please give them your guidance and counsel in this matter.

*** Induction to the Order of the Laurel ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Members of the Order of the Laurel.

_Members of the Order assemble._

Herald
: It has long been recognised that there are those among us who are much deserving of high honour, but who, by reason of the nature and direction of their services and achievement, come not to the glory of warrior or throne, yet without whom our land would not be half so blessed.

Therefore was created the Order of the Laurel, to recognise those who, possessing all the other skills, virtues and attributes appropriate to members of the Peerage, shall also have distinguished themselves by their outstanding achievement in the Arts and Sciences.

And the symbol of this Order is a medallion bearing a laurel wreath, for the chaplet of laurel has long been acknowledged as a mark of superior achievement, and this Order ranks in precedence with the Orders of Chivalry, the Pelican, and Defence. It carries with it a Patent of Arms.

Escort
: Your Majesties, having consulted with the Order, is it your desire to increase our numbers at this time?

Monarch
: It is. Please bring the candidate forward.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Laurel to speak for the candidate?

Laurel
: _Speaks of the achievements of the candidate in the arts and sciences._

Herald
: But while the arts and sciences enhance the Realm, it must be fostered by strength and chivalry. The order of Chivalry stands as primary of these attributes, but they are also required of a member of the Order of the Laurel.

Knight
: _Speaks about the chivalry and/or prowess in arms of the candidate._

Pelican
: _Speaks of the service done by the candidate._

Defence
: _Speaks about the candidate’s grace and long dedication to the art._

: Let the new M___ be vested as befits their new rank.

_A chaplet of laurel leaves is placed on the new peer's head and a Laurel's cloak is placed around the peer's shoulders, while the herald says the following._

: From ancient times, the chaplet of laurel has been placed on the heads of those worthy of special honour and recognition.

### 3 Order of the Pelican

*** Invocation of the Vigil ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of the Pelican.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst Our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: My Lord/Lady/other appropriate title, your acts of service and counsel are known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of the Pelican.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Pelican
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of the Peerage. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that – but more, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oath you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Knight or Master / Mistress of Arms:_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, but no less chivalrous behaviour will be expected of you. As a Peer of the Realm you must endeavour to live, as you have until now, by the rules of courtesy and gentle behaviour. This courtly ideal is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Laurel:_

The Order of the Laurel is the order of the Arts and Sciences, but a Pelican must also encourage the Arts and Sciences, not just by appreciating them, but by participating in their practice, for the greatest service you can render to your Land is to make it whole and harmonious, and devoid of the beauty and braces of Art, that it cannot be.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Defence:_

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons, but you too are expected to serve and defend the Crown and their realm with tenacity and grace, and to teach those willing to learn the arts of maintaining this our Society.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Pelican._

The Order of the Pelican is unique among the four orders of Peerage. Every Peer of the Realm, be they of the Order of the Chivalry, Laurel, Defence or Pelican, has the responsibility to serve: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each performing to the best of their abilities. But the service expected of a Pelican is far greater than that expected of the other Peers, and greater still than that expected of the populace at large. You must be the first to offer your help, and the last to accept reward; you must not falter when the task becomes more difficult than you anticipated; and you must not remain content with your past accomplishments, for although they are great, and for this reason are you being created a Peer, it is by your future achievements that you will be judged by those who seek to follow the example of a Peer.

To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider 	our offer and please give them your guidance and counsel in this matter.

*** Induction to the Order of the Pelican ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Members of the Order of the Pelican.

Herald
: It has long been recognised that there are those among us who are much deserving of high honour, but who, by reason of the nature and direction of their services and achievement, come not to the glory of warrior or throne, yet without whom our land would not be half so blessed.

Therefore was created the Order of the Pelican, to recognise those who, possessing all the other skills, virtues and attributes appropriate to members of the Peerage, shall also have distinguished themselves by their sustained and exemplary service to the Society.

The symbol of this Order is a medallion bearing a Pelican in her Piety, for as we all know, the Pelican will, when necessary, nourish her young with blood from her own breast. Hence, the Pelican has come to represent sacrifice, and become the symbol of the good servant. And this Order ranks in precedence with the Orders of Chivalry, Laurel, and Defence. It carries with it a Patent of Arms.

Escort
: Your Majesties, having consulted with the Order, is it Your desire to increase our numbers at this time?

Monarch
: It is. Please bring the candidate forward.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Chivalry to speak for the candidate?

Knight
: _Speaks about the chivalry and/or prowess in arms of the candidate._

Herald
: But whilst service may uphold a Realm, it does not make it flourish. Without the Arts and Sciences, the land is bare and barren. The Order of the Laurel is the Order of the Arts and Sciences. But to appreciate why they serve the Kingdom, a member of the Pelican must have knowledge of the Arts and Sciences.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Laurel to speak for the candidate?

Laurel
: _Speaks of the candidate in respect to their accomplishments in / appreciation of arts and sciences._

Herald
: The Kingdom is defended and championed in many different ways. While the Order of Defence is the Order of Steel, Swordsmanship and Art of Arms, a member of the Order of the Pelican is also defending the Realm in their own manner.

Monarch

Defence
: _Speaks about the candidate’s grace and long dedication to the kingdom and society._

Candidate
: I will, Your Majesty.

Herald
: Will you, to the best of your ability, continue in the cause of service, as you most surely have until now, and seek to increase your labours and talents nobly, and train any dependants you may have to do likewise, so far as it is within your powers?

Candidate
: I will.

Monarch
: Make known our Royal will.

_Herald reads scroll, hands it to Monarch. Monarch hands it to candidate. Monarch receives the medallion from the provider, usually a member of the Order.

Monarch
: Let the new M___ be vested as befits their new rank.

_A cap of maintenance is placed on the new peer's head and a Pelican's cloak is placed around the peer's shoulders, while the herald says the following._

Herald
: Since times immemorial, the cap of maintenance is the symbol of the Pelican, for just as the cap of maintenance supports the crown and makes it easier to bear, so the Pelican supports the Kingdom and eases the burden of its rulers.

The cloak is the outward sign of the Pelican's new status as a peer of the realm.

Monarch
: M___ ____________ , is it your wish to swear fealty to us at this time?

: Congratulations, M___ ____________ . Go now to your peers.


### 4 Order of Defence

*** Invocation of the Vigil ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of all members of the Order of Defence.

_The order comes forward._

Monarch
: Good my Peers, We seek counsel! Will you give us this?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Word has reached us that there is one amongst Our people who is a Peer in truth, but not in name. Is this so?

Order
: Yes.

Monarch
: Let us summon the candidate.

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of __________________.	

Monarch
: __________, your skill with arms is known to us, your virtues beyond reproach. It is our wish to make you a member of the Order of Defence.

Herald / Sponsor / Senior Defender
: It is necessary that I address you, concerning aspects of Peerage, Courtesy and the Scholarship of Defence. It is often said that Peerage is an honour. It is surely that - but more, it is a responsibility, which you should not take upon yourself lightly, but with sobriety and sincerity. The oaths you will be offered will bind you in fealty to the Crown; and it is well that you should understand what you are about to promise.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Pelican:_

The Order of the Pelican is the order of Service, and yet, a Master of Defence must serve as well: not only the Crown, but the land as a whole, each companion of the Defence performing to the best of their ability, and then to that point of performance where sacrifice is required. A Peer must be ready and willing to do good works, and must do them more frequently and more extensively than their friends who are not Peers.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Laurel:_

The Order of the Laurel is the order of the Arts and Sciences. The Art of Defence may be the defining one for a swordmaster, but he too must endorse and encourage the full field of Arts and Sciences, not only by appreciating, but by participating in their practice, for what the skills of a swordmaster might win may be made barren and cold by the combat itself; only the warm heart can nurture the land and its people and bring them to their fullest potential. Heed well the example of teaching from the Companions of the Laurel, as that is the very art that in addition to your own you will require to fully achieve the estate of a mastery.

_The next paragraph may be read by a Member of the Chivalry:_

The Knights and the Masters of Arms are the Order of Chivalry, but no less chivalrous behaviour will be expected of you. As a Peer of the Realm you must endeavour to live, as you have until now, by the rules of courtesy and gentle behaviour. The courtly ideal is your guide in your conduct with others, whether they be fellow Peers, or the humblest of the populace; for indeed, the lowlier the station of those with whom you treat, the greater is your influence over them. Deal with them justly and fairly, regardless of station, be gracious and courteous to all, be an example to whom others can look.

_Return to the Herald / Sponsor / Senior Defender._

The Order of Defence is the order noted for its deadly art and scholarship of weapons. The swordmasters of the order stand as the foremost examples of grace and form, not only in swordsplay but in all manner of courtliness setting the standard of the gentles in our royal courts. A companion of Defence, a swordmaster, must display equal grace in victory and in defeat; he must not suffer injustice, but neither should he seek vengeance; he must remember that as his reputation depends upon his skill in delivering sure thrusts and clever cuts, so it also depends upon the way in which he receives them. Be mindful that a Peer guides, not only by his word, but also by the example he sets for others.

As a swordmaster you need to continue your scholarship and study of not only the Art of Defence and all others of the courtly arts as being a Master is being a scholar who is now responsible for not only his own improvement but of the improvement of others as well. Remember the demands and dictates of courtesy, honour, and chivalry and being true to the Order you are about to enter, defend them by your life, limb and heart, both In fields of combat and halls of our Courts. Teaching the love of them as well as your art to all those who look upon you for guidance.

	To accept elevation to the Peerage is to accept these responsibilities. I pray you, keep these 	words in your heart, as you prepare for your new status.

Monarch
: Good peers, please escort __________________ to their vigil to consider our offer and please give them your guidance and council in this matter.

*** Induction to the Order of Defence ***

Herald
: Their Majesties command the presence of the Members of the Order of Defence.

_Members of the Order assemble._

Herald
: It has long been recognized that not only in the tournament combat and melee, but in the study and practice of the Art of Defence as well, is the true strength and prowess of the Kingdom forged. Since times of antiquity has this art been practised, honed and taught by those first amongst the swordsmen who have dedicated themselves to pursuit of the mastery of steel. A number of these also possess the virtues we expect and demand from the peers of our Society, they are much deserving of our recognition and tribute, not only by their skills with true edge of steel, but their nobility of heart, grace of their manner and service to our realms as whole.

Therefore was created the Order of Defence, the fourth Order of the Society bearing a Patent of Arms and ranking equally with the Orders of Chivalry, Laurel and Pelican, to be bestowed on the worthiest of our gentles when elevating them to the ranks of Peers of the realm. The Order of Defence exists to recognize those of our Swordsmen, Warriors and Scholars of the Arts of Arms who display not only these but also all other qualities expected from the Peers of the Realm and who by their love of Arts not only that of defence and their service and largesse support these lands and the Crown.

Escort
: Your Majesties, having consulted with the Order, is it Your desire to increase our numbers at this time?

Monarch
: It is. Please bring the candidate forward.

_Escort brings candidate forward._

Escort
: Your Majesty, it is my privilege, to present____________ , that they may be made a member of our order.

_At this point it is possible to have members of the peerage orders to speak for the candidate:_

Herald
: By all manner of arms and combat the Kingdom is defended and championed. The Order of Defence is the Order of Steel, Swordsmanship and Art of Arms.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of Defence to speak for the candidate?

Defence
: _Speaks about the candidate’s long dedication, skill and inspiration in the art of defence and of his grace in field and court._

Herald
: No matter the greatness of the Warrior or the Artisan, without Service, they remain isolated, shared not with the Realm. The Order of the Pelican is the Order of Service, but a M______ of Defence must also serve the Crown and the Realm.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Pelican to speak for the candidate?

Pelican
: _Speaks of the service done by the candidate._

Herald
: Not only Artfulness of Swordmanship and eye of measure but also the strength of arm and chivalry of heart make one a true warrior. The Order of Chivalry stands as primary of these attributes.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Chivalry to speak for the candidate?

Chivalry
: _Speaks about the chivalry and/or prowess in arms of the candidate._

Herald
: But whilst Force of Arms may defend a Realm, it does not make it flourish. Without the Arts and Sciences, the land is bare and barren. The Order of the Laurel is the Order of the Arts and Sciences. But to appreciate what they defend, a M_____ of Defence must have knowledge of the Arts and Sciences.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Laurel to speak for the candidate?

Laurel
: _Speaks of the candidate in respect to their accomplishments in / appreciation of arts and sciences._

Herald
: A swords__man may be mighty, but without courtesy and honour they are no Peer. The Order of the Rose speaks for courtesy and honour.

Monarch
: Is there a member of the Order of the Rose to speak for the candidate?

Rose
: _Speaks of the courtesy of the candidate._

Herald
: Drachenwald has many Peers, but many more who are not Peers, and their voice is mighty, to be ignored at the peril of all! Is there a message from the People of the Realm in regard to this candidate?

**Representative of the populace
: _Speaks of the largesse, humility or fairness the candidate exhibits in how he interacts with the rest of the society._

_Monarch turns to the sponsor._

Monarch
: Do you, M___ ____________ , and the other members of your order affirm their worthiness for this high honour, accepting them as your peer in service and in the other attributes of peerage?

Defenders
: I do.

Monarch
: It is our judgement that the candidate fulfils all the requirements of peerage.

Monarch
: ____________ , right mindful of your achievement and service to Our land, and responsive to the wishes of your peers, We are minded to create you a M___ of Defence. Will you accept from us this honour and the badge of your achievement?

Candidate
: I will, Your Majesty.

Herald
: Will you, to the best of your ability, continue in the cause of service, as you most surely have until now, and seek to increase your labours and talents nobly, and train any dependants you may have to do likewise, so far as it is within your powers?

Candidate
: I will.

Monarch
: Make known Our Royal will.

_Herald reads scroll, hands it to Monarch. Monarch hands it to candidate. Monarch receives the collar of the order from the provider, usually a member of the Order. It is appropriate to here relate to the history of the collar, if any. Monarch places the collar around candidate’s neck, as he says the following._

Monarch
: ____________ , take from Our hands this token of your achievement and Our esteem. Henceforth be M___ ____________ .

Monarch
: Let the new M___ be vested as befits their new rank.

_A cloak of the order is placed around the peer's shoulders, while the herald says the following._

Herald
: As a cape defends the body from cold, so defends a Master of Defence the realm and crown. As the cape displays the sign of the Masters' new status as a peer of the realm, underneath it carries the symbol of the Order of the Dragon's Steel so the heritage of the Order of Defence in the lands of Albion would not be forgotten.

The particular sign for a Master of Defence is the white collar of maintenance where the collar's pure colour symbolizes his honour, intentions and aspirations the very name of the garment reminding him how he as a peer, ought to maintain the realm, the crown and our common ideals thus making the crown lighter to bear as he defends our Sovereigns and their realm from all that might wish harm or slurs upon the Golden shields of the Kingdom and Society.

Monarch
: M___ ____________ , is it your wish to swear fealty to us at this time?

Candidate
: ____________

**_If yes:_**

_Monarch receives Sword of State. The new peer places his hands on the sword, the Crowns place their hands upon his hands._

Herald
: Will you hold ____________ and ____________ your rightful Sovereigns, right until the end of their lawful reign, and support their royal might and justice?

Candidate
: I will.

Herald
: Do you wish to give the Crown such counsel which is to the benefit of them and their Realm, and support them in upholding the laws and fulfilling their coronation oath?

Defence
: I do.

Herald
: And will you keep secret such matters as the Crown wants to keep in confidence, and not divulge such secrets that could harm their Realm?

Defence
: I will.

Monarch
: And We in turn promise to grant you and your household all the rights and privileges of old, and to protect you with the Law of the Realm.

So say We ____________ , Rex/Regina

Monarch
: So say We ____________ , Rex/Regina.

_Crown raises the new Master/Mistress of Defence._

Monarch
: Congratulations, M___ ____________ . Go now to your peers.


# Part IX Baronies

In Drachenwald, baronage, both territorial and of the court, ranks between peerage and grant-level awards. The ceremonies for investing barons and baronesses are accordingly listed in the section of grant-level awards. A Grant of Arms is often given with a court barony, but this is not automatic and so must be explicitly proclaimed at court.

## 1. Investiture of Landed Baronies

# Part X  Grant of Arms Level Awards

Court Note: **Ring and Wing sound almost identical in English, especially in the probably imperfect acoustics of a court. Sometimes the entire Ring may be addressed and others just those of the Wing. Make sure that it is very clear which is being referred to. I, Nicholas, have in the past already been caught out once by mishearing this in court.

There is no formal ceremony for giving a plain Grant of Arms. The normal method is for the person to be called to the Royal presence; the Crown then has the opportunity to talk about the accomplishments of the person, after which the herald reads the scroll and calls for vivats.

Bear in mind that granting arms is specific to certain places and times within period. It is acceptable to substitute an equivalent type of ceremony and scroll to suit the recipient's persona.

The three grant level orders listed here rank above a plain Grant of Arms, and if the recipient has not already got a Grant of Arms it comes by Kingdom law automatically with the membership in the order. In such a case, this should be proclaimed at court, for example by reading the scroll that mentions the fact explicitly.

It is traditional for the existing members of an Order to make themselves known, either by being called forward, or more commonly as they increase in size, by simply standing in place. Neither is mandatory, and an easy win when faced with a long court is to omit this part.

In some Kingdoms it is traditional to style gentles with a grant of arns as Honorable Lord/Lady. This is not an official title of the SCA, and whilst not officially recognised within Drachenwald, there is no barrier to using this style, especially if the holder or recipient desires it.

Herald
: _This introduction can be dispensed with if time is short._

: Drachenwald is rich with stories of rings. Rings of might, circles of knights and rings of legend: some made by gods of old, others forged by men seeking to build a better world and live by the greatest of ideals. Thus inspired, the rulers of Drachenwald added to this long tradition by creating our Kingdom’s own Order of the Ring, called in Latin, Ordo Annuli. This order is the circle of trust and protection around our Crown, this order is the circle of pillars supporting the thrones and this order is the chaplet of stars resting on the royal brow. The order is one unified circle, composed of three entwined companies of greatness.

: _This ordering is arbitrary, and can be changed as appropriate or just to reinforce that no company is greater than the others._

: The Order of the Swallow, formally called Ordo Hirundinis, whose companions are noted for their service and diligence. The Order of the Swan, formally called Ordo Cygni, whose companions are noted for the grace of their art and philosophy. The Order of the Wing, formally called Ordo Alae, the Crown's allies in deeds of arms, noted for their prowess and courage.

: _For longer courts, depending on which orders are being presented, and in what order, it may expedient to call upon the entire Order of the Ring, or just the Company specifically involved._

Herald
: _Be very clear here, where required, to distinguish between 'Ring' and 'Wing', hence why including the Latin form is a good idea._

: Their Majesties call forth all companions of Ordo Annuli, the Order of the Ring, to bear witness and stand by them in their following deeds.1

**or**

: Their Majesties bid all companions of Ordo Annuli, the Order of the Ring, to stand or make themselves known to witness their following deeds.

**or**

_Substitute a specific order in one of the forms above._

: Their Majesties call before them _Title_ _________ __________.

_The recipient kneels before the Crown._

Monarch
: We are well pleased with


* your prowess and courage on the field,
* your skills in the arts and philosophy,
* your service, diligence,

and your gentle conduct at all the times. Thus we are minded to create you a Companion of the

* Wing
* Swan
* Swallow

and, through that Company, create/confirm you as a member of the Order of the Ring.

Make known our command.

Herald
: _Reads the scroll text and hands it to the Crown._

_A token appropriate to the company is given to the Crown, either by an attendant or one of the appropriate Company. The Crown then bestows the token._

Monarch
: __________, take from Our hands this token of your achievement and rank, and of Our esteem. Henceforth you are a Companion of the Ring.

Go forth and greet your companions.

Herald
: _Note a pre-existing title may trump that below._

For _[the Honorable]_ Lord/Lady _________. Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!


# Part XI Award of Arms Level Awards

There is no formal ceremony for giving a plain Award of Arms. The normal method is for the person to be called to the Royal presence; the Crown then has the opportunity to talk about the accomplishments of the person, after which the herald reads the scroll and calls for vivats.

Bear in mind that awarding arms is specific to certain places and times within period. It is acceptable to substitute an equivalent type of ceremony and scroll to suit the recipient's persona.

The three armigerous orders listed here rank above a plain Award of Arms, and if the recipient has not already got an Award of Arms it comes by Kingdom law automatically with the membership in the order. In such a case, this should be proclaimed at court, for example by reading the scroll that mentions the fact explicitly.

It is traditional for the existing members of an Order to make themselves known, either by being called forward, or more commonly as they increase in size, by simply standing in place. Neither is mandatory, and an easy win when faced with a long court is to omit this part.


## 1. Orden des Lindquistringes

Herald
: Their Majesties command all members of the Orden des Lindquistringes to stand / come forward..

_T	he members do as they are bid._

Herald
: As the Crown serve the people of Drachenwald throughout their reign, they set the example of service for all their subjects. All those who enjoy the beauty and prosperity that is Drachenwald are expected to render service when required, to the best of their abilities.

There are those few, however, whose service consistently exceeds the expectations of their offices or ranks and who are, therefore, especially worthy of reward.

The Orden des Lindquistringes was created to honour the memory of one whose great honour and service helped to build our beloved land. It is given to those persons who have served Drachenwald above and beyond the normal contributions of a loyal subject.

And so do Their Majesties call before Them ____________ .

_Recipient comes forward, bows and kneels. The Crowns may make personal statements._

_Herald reads scroll and hands it to a Crown. The Crown names the artist of the scroll, shows it to the populace and hands it to recipient. The Crowns raise the recipient._

Herald
: For ____________ , the newest member of the Orden des Lindquistringes, Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!


## 2. Order of the Panache

Herald
: Their Majesties command all members all members of the Order of the to stand / come forward..

_The members do as they are bid._

Herald
: As the Crown reward service and valour, so too do they seek to encourage the development of artistic skills and philosophic expertise among their subjects. When a person has excelled consistently in the Arts or Natural Phiosophy, and has shared that beauty and knowledge with others, it becomes not only the duty, but the joy of the Crown to recognize such endeavour.

Therefore was created the Order of the Panache, to be given as a sign of the Crown's recognition of the exceptional skill with which these individuals increase the beauty and wisdom of Drachenwald.

And so do their Majesties call before Them ____________ .

_Recipient comes forward, bows and kneels. The Crowns may make personal statements._

_Herald reads scroll and hands it to a Crown. The Crown names the artist of the scroll, shows it to the populace and hands it to recipient. The Crowns raise the recipient._

Herald
: For ____________ , the newest member of the Order of the Panache, Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!


## 3.  Order of the Silver Guard

Herald
: Their Majesties command all members all members of the Order of the to stand / come forward..

_The members do as they are bid._

Herald
: Many a noble warrior has donned armour in order to pursue their fortunes upon the tourney field, defend their land from a foe or follow their Lord as sworn by oath.

There are those, however, whose prowess in combat inspires their companions-at-arms and whose noble demeanour brings glory and honour to Drachenwald. These are especially deserving of reward.

Thus does the Crown recognises such individuals by admitting them to the Order of the Silver Guard, that all may know these gentles and be instructed by their example

And so do Their Majesties call before them ____________ .

_Recipient comes forward, bows and kneels. The Crowns may make personal statements._

_Herald reads scroll and hands it to a Crown. The Crown names the artist of the scroll, shows it to the populace and hands it to recipient. The Crowns raise the recipient._

Herald
: For ____________ , the newest member of the Order of the Silver Guard, Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!


## 4.  Non-Armigerous Awards

For all these awards, after the recipients are called to the court, the Crown may address them. After this, the herald reads a scroll, if there is one, and the Crown hands the recipient the scroll or a token. While the recipient retires from the presence, the herald calls for vivats.


## 5. The Order of the Companions of Albion

_This is a very long ceremony. It is not recommended in full for courts which will be long for other reasons._

Herald
: In the years before history was recorded in our land, in a dark forest to the North, called in German the “Schwarzwald”, which means the “Black Forest”, there lived an ancient black dragon whose name was Albion. And it was in this forest one winter's day that Albion came across a young boy. He was but fifteen and he was Prince of the land, and his name was Yustav, and he was crying.

And Albion said, “Your Highness, why dost thou sit so in the winter snow?”

Yustav said, “Friend Albion, tomorrow my people go off to hunt, and they would have me be a great hunter, but try as I might, I cannot catch a deer nor kill a fowl, and how shall I be a great Prince if I cannot hunt?”

Albion pondered this a moment, and then with a great wrenching of his mighty jaws, he severed the tail from his body, and he burned it in the fiery flame of his breath. He said unto Yustav, “Take this, my tail, and use it as a spear, and with it you shall kill the swiftest deer, the largest boar, and you shall be hailed in all the lands as the greatest hunter.”

Yustav took the spear upon him, and he went off to the hunt, and when he had returned what Albion had told him was true, for he had killed the swiftest deer, the largest boar, and he was hailed in all the lands as the great hunter.

Whereupon ten years went by, and Albion came upon a somewhat older Prince, now twenty-five, who was sitting in the snow, weeping.

And Albion said, “Your Highness, why dost thou sit weeping in the snow?”

And Yustav said, “Friend Albion, tomorrow my people go to war, but I fear for my life. If only my skin were as hard as yours, then I would be courageous in combat, and fearing no enemy, I could be a warrior. How can I be Prince if I cannot fight?”

Albion pondered this for a moment, and then with a mighty clenching of his claws, he ripped the scales from his flesh, and he heaped them in a pile before Yustav, saying, “Your Highness, take these my scales. Have them sewn onto a coat, and you shall have the finest armour in all the lands. You will be untouchable in battle. Fearless, you will be hailed as the greatest warrior.”

Yustav took up the scales unto him, took them to his armourer and had them made into a suit of armour. When he returned from the wars, what Albion had told him was true. Fearless in combat, knowing that no blade could touch him, no axe could reach him, he killed the largest number of enemies and was hailed as the greatest warrior.

Twenty years went by, and Albion, a little worse for wear with no tail and no scales, came across the now mature Prince of forty-five who was sitting in the snow, brooding.

And he said, “ Your Highness, why dost thou sit so stern of face and pale of countenance?”

And Yustav said, “Friend Albion, I would take me a wife, but the lady that I would have is of great wealth and stature. There is nothing I can give her which she does not already possess. How can I be a Prince if I do not have a Princess?”

Albion pondered this a moment, and then with a mighty clenching of his claws he wrenched the teeth from his very mouth, and he placed them before the Prince, saying, “Your Highness, take these, my teeth. Have them placed in placards of ivory and you shall have the finest combs in all the land to gift your lady with.”

Yustav took up the teeth from him, and had them made into fine combs, and his Princess agreed to marry him, and he lived happily.

Whereupon twenty years went by, and Albion, much weaker, much smaller than before, for with no teeth he could catch only the smallest of field mice, the slowest of fowl, came across a now ageing Prince of sixty-five, who sat shivering in the snow.

And he said, “Your Highness, why dost thou sit here so coldly in the snow?”

Yustav said, “Friend Albion, my bones grow old, and the winters are cold. There is no heat to worm the inner ice. I fear that soon shall I die.”

Albion pondered this a moment, and then with his razor-sharp claws he plucked the heart from his breast, and placed it before the Prince, saying, “Your Highness, take this, my heart. Have it made into a fine robe, for there is nothing warmer in all the lands. Wear it and you shall live.”

Yustav took up the giant heart and had it made into a robe, and the dragon's words again were true, for Yustav did live.

Ten years went by, and Yustav awoke, and he realised that after all the years, after all the gifts that Albion had given him, so unselfishly, so chivalrously, not once, not once had the Prince thanked him. And he grieved. He told his son, Wilhelm, who would soon be Prince, that he would seek out a friend in the Schwarzwald, and there he went to find his friend, Albion.

Now, as we all know, a dragon may live without scales, or tail, or even teeth, but without a heart the essence, which is the magic of a dragon, is no more, and all that remains are the bones left by the vultures and the dragon's claws. And that is what Yustav found there in the clearing of Albion - the many scattered bones left by the vultures and predators, and the many sable claws of Albion. The Prince fell to his knees and wept.

After many hours, Wilhelm called for a search to find his father, but it was Wilhelm himself who found the Prince there in the landing. He took his father into his arms, and with dying words and rasping breath, Yustav told Wilhelm the story of Albion and of his many gifts, whereupon he died.

Wilhelm took up his father and laid on a great funeral, and he was shortly thereafter made Prince of the land. His first official act as Prince was to make dragons a protected species in the land.

After many years the people, having heard the legend of Albion, lost the old name of their land and took up a new and popular one, calling themselves “Drachenwald”, meaning in the German the “Dragon Forest”, and Albion became the symbol of this land.

The new Prince, who was called Richard, thought that in some manner he should make his memory lasting, and so he created an Order, into which could be admitted only those who their own interests could forget while serving others. So chivalrous, so noble, so true must they be that they would be likened by their peers to the memory of Albion. And he styled the Order “The Royal Order of the Companions of Albion” and he took as its symbol a sable claw of the great dragon. Following the tradition of the Princes of Drachenwald and of the great Albion himself, do the Sovereigns of Drachenwald reward their most faithful servants, even to this very day.

_Pause._

And so does their Majesty call before them ____________ .

_(The Albion story was written by Viscount Richard Gilchrest, who created the Order during his reign as Prince.)_


## 6. The Order of Courtesy

_This is a very long ceremony. It is not recommended in full for courts which will be long for other reasons._

Herald
: Long ago, the lands of Drachenwald were forged into a mighty Kingdom, and in the King’s, army was a virtuous but impoverished noble. One day in the fierce heat of battle, a foul arrow struck them under the arm, where they were lightly armoured, and they fell. The chirurgeon, knowing the esteem in which the noble was held, worked long into the night to save them. Eventually, the arrowhead was withdrawn, but it was clear that they could play no further part in that campaign.

“A good and courteous subject,” said the King to His Queen, “but they are now of no use to us. Lay them in a carriage and send them home to retire.”

When the noble awoke from their fever, the Queen went to them and said, “Your service has been gallant, but in your condition, you can no longer fight. You have leave to depart.” They could not stand, but the noble sat up and said, “Your Majesty, I can no longer wield my sword, yet I beg that I be allowed to stay so that I may be of use wherever I can, for my heart still beats with a love of Drachenwald.”

And so the noble followed the army. Their pain and misery at being unable to fight alongside their King and Queen in the front rank was almost beyond endurance.

But, the Queen noted, not once did they complain. They made their bed in the open, along with the servants, shared their meagre rations without demur, fetched firewood and stirred the pot alongside the lowliest cook.

As the wound began to heal, they took up further tasks. They rode with messages or on errands for the Sovereigns. Even when requests for assistance were made by the lowliest servant, it was greeted with a smile and left with a charming farewell. Never did they think of their own needs, but rather always saw the world through the eyes of those around, anticipating their needs and making their burdens less wearisome.

Some of the maids had children that ran about their feet whilst they tried to work. The noble began to look after the children for a while each day, so that the ladies might have peace. He taught the children games and skills that would be of benefit to them in later life, and he told them moral tales. These children came from the humblest families – yet this noble treated them all with the same grace and courtesy as if they had been the children of the King and Queen themselves.

One day, the army was passing through a region of high mountains in terrible weather. Thunder shook the walls of rock around them, and lightning flashed overhead. Rain turned every stream into a torrent laden with fallen branches and tumbling rocks.

The Queen turned to one of her ladies-in-waiting, asking, “Where is that kind and gracious noble who was wounded? I would have them organise our camp for tonight.”

A while later, the lady returned, saying “Your Majesty, it grieves me to tell you, but that gentle is nowhere to be found.”

The Queen ordered, “Search the army and find this noble indivduak, for they are of great service to me, and I would have him at my side.”

Eventually, a young peasant was brought before the Queen.

“Your Majesty,” he said, “it is my fault that your noble servant is not here. Please forgive me.”

“Do not be afraid,” said the Queen, “just tell me what has happened.”

“I am a goatherd,” said the youngster, “and my flock provides your Majesty with fine cheeses and fresh milk. But this morning, when this terrible storm arose, my animals took fright and scattered. Your noble servant found me crying at my plight, and immediately set off to find my goats although the thunder threatened to blast them from those dreadful rocks.” The child turned and pointed to a rocky ridge that climbed thousands of feet to be lost in the clouds.

The King said to the Queen “They risk their life even for a mere peasant, and had they already returned, we would never have known of their toil. But they have always been so.”

The Queen replied, “it is true that even the greatest deeds can pass unnoticed. But now, we must find our noble friend, for they are in grave danger in this storm. I beg you to find them.”

Patrols were sent into the mountains, and at length, a trumpet call sounded. Their Majesties mounted their steeds, and clambered up the treacherous paths, until they found the soldiers.

“Look!” called the sergeant-at-arms, pointing further ahead. And there, descending through the mist, with staff in hand, guiding a flock of goats, was the noble friend, singing a jaunty song in defiance of the storm.

Surprised to be greeted by such a retinue, they bowed deeply. “Your Majesties,” they said, “surely you cannot be here on my account. How may I help you?” They spread their arms wide, and their Majesties could see both hands were cut and grazed from the perilous climb.

The King spoke. “Noble warrior, I can see your strength has returned, and your courage has evidently not faltered, so you may rejoin the army with my blessing.”

The Queen smiled. “Noble servant,” she said, “We came in search of one whose values we would protect. You never complain at your misfortunes. Not once have you sought attention at the expense of others. Unseen, you work to ensure that the honour of Drachenwald and its people is upheld. But in particular, it is the unstinting courtesy that you have shown to young and old, to high and low-born alike, that has made this long journey and difficult task not a labour, but a joy, and for that we thank you.”

With this, the Queen noticed something in the noble herder's belt. “What is that flower caught in your clothing?” she asked.

The noble saw that an edelweiss was lodged in their buckle, so they handed it to the Queen. As they did so, a drop of his blood stained its centre. “It is an edelweiss, your Majesty, that grows only on the highest peaks, for it was there that I found the goats, sheltering from the gale.”

The Queen turned to her husband, saying “Your Majesty, I beg of you this boon. The honours of Drachenwald are mostly in your gift, but I would ask that I, too, may create an Order to which only the most worthy may be admitted.”

“So be it,” replied the King, “know you all that I grant Her Majesty this wish.”

The Queen spoke again. “Noble friend, your courtesy and love of Drachenwald is an example to us all and is almost beyond reward. But let this flower be now worn as a rare badge of honour, for the Consorts of Drachenwald alone to bestow, from now until the world ends.”

And so she pinned the edelweiss to the noble's breast, and charged them to promote the study of courtesy for as long as they should live.

And so from that time forth, exceptional individuals have been inducted into the Order of Courtesy, in this fashion, either as a pin or on a silver chain: an edelweiss argent eyed gules.

_Pause._

And so does their Majesty call before them ____________ .

## 7. Sigilla Coronarum

*** By both Sovereign and Consort together ***

Herald
: The duties and responsibilities of the Crown are many. Our Sovereign by blood must be a source of strength and wisdom for the people. They must be foremost in valour upon the battlefield, yet gentlest in courtesy of any in the Realm. Their Consort must be a patron of artists and philosophers. They must be the embodiment of gentle grace, courtesy, virtue and love that her subjects deserve. Together, as one, they must govern and rule this land.

: Although our Sovereigns are supported by all loyal subjects whose service they may command, there are those subjects without whom they could not rule half so joyously, for their constant attention to Royal needs makes light the day-to-day details of ruling and their tireless devotion serves to ease the burden of Royal responsibilities.

: Therefore was created the Sigillum Coronae, to recognise those individuals, whose personal service to the Crown far exceeds any expected measure. And the badge of the award shall be a white Edelweiss surmounted by a black dragon's head bearing the sigils of the Crown bestowing it.

: So now do their Majesties call before them ____________ .

*** Sigillum Coronae/Regis/Reginae (by the Sovereign) ***

Herald
: The duties and responsibilities of a Sovereign are many. They must govern and rule the land. They must be a source of strength and wisdom for their people. They must be foremost in valour upon the battlefield, yet gentlest in courtesy of any noble in the Realm.

: Although They are supported by not only their Inspiration, but by all loyal subjects whose service They may command, there are those of Their subjects without whom the Crown could not rule half so joyously, for their constant attention to Their needs makes light the day-to-day job of ruling and their tireless devotion serves to ease the burden of Royal responsibility.

: Therefore was created the Sigillum Coronae, to recognise those individuals, whose personal service to the Crown far exceeds any expected measure. And the badge of the award shall be a black dragon's head charged with the sigil of the Crown bestowing it.

: So now does their Majesty call before them ____________ .

*** Sigillum Consortis/Regis/Regina (by the Consort) ***

Herald
: The duties and responsibilities of a Consort are many. They must govern and rule the land. They must be a patron of the arts and natural philosophy. They must be the embodiment of gentle grace, courtesy, virtue and love that their subjects expect.

: Although They are supported by not only their Champion, but by all loyal subjects whose service they may command, there are those of their subjects without whom the Crown could not rule half so joyously, for their constant attention to their needs makes light the day-to-day details of ruling and their tireless devotion serves to ease the burden of Royal responsibility.

: Therefore was created the Sigillum Consortis, to recognise those individuals, whose personal service to the Consort far exceeds any expected measure. And the badge of the award shall be a white Edelweiss charged with the sigil of the Consort bestowing it.

: So now does their Majesty call before them ____________ .

## 8. The Order of the Dragon's Tear

Herald
: Whenever members of the Kingdom gather to fight or dance, revel or conduct business, there are responsibilities which fall to the hosts so that all may enjoy the event. It sometimes happens, however, that a heavy burden falls upon a single individual or small group, so that a great number of people might find special enjoyment.

Thus was created the Order of the Dragon's Tear, for those worthy souls who, as event stewards, overcome special difficulties or provide a particularly enriching experience for the populace. And these gentles shall be known by a teardrop-shaped pendant worn on a cord in the colours of Drachenwald.

Now therefore do their Majesties call before them ____________ .

## 9. The Order of the Dragon's Bowle

Herald
: The occasion is always joyous when we gather together. However, the occasion is doubly blessed when we can also enjoy a special display of beauty and art. Therefore was created the Order of the Dragon's Bowle, to be given at the Crown's discretion to those gentles whose care, attention and artfulness in equipping themselves enhances the spirit of the event to the delight of all.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________ .

## 10. The Order of the Dragon's Jewel

Herald
: We delight in the presence of children, because We know they represent the future of all We hold all dear; but there are those young nobles who contribute to our Kingdom and the Society not only beyond the measure of their fellows, but also beyond the measure of their years.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________ .

## 11. The Order of the Dragon's Pride

Herald
: The reward of artistic achievement and scientific knowledge is a joyful duty for the Crown, as the product of such labour brings delight to all who are touched by it; but when the skill resides in one of tender years, the joy is especially great, since the Crown rewards not only the work itself, but the promise of greater things to come.

Therefore was created the Order of the Dragon's Pride, to reward artistic or philosophic achievement in a young member of the people.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________ .

## 12. Popular Company of Sojourners

Herald
: Our beloved realm was founded by travellers who came to this land from distant shores and made it their home. We are proud that to this day, travellers still come and abide in our land.

But alas, as travellers come, they also go, and often it is our sad task to bid farewell to those whose path leads them away from Drachenwald. It is especially sad when those travellers have served the Kingdom well and become beloved of the people.

Thus was created the Popular Company of Sojourners, to recognise those who leave Drachenwald the richer for their time here.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________

## 13. The Order of the Hospitallers of Albion

Herald
: There are times when the Crown of Drachenwald travels to distant lands either to stand with other kingdoms on the field of battle, fighting injustice and defending the weak, or for the pleasure to be gained from foreign travels where the beauty of the Known World may be experienced and enjoyed. During these travels, the Crown is sometimes aided and supported by gentles of those foreign lands, whose sacrifice on behalf of our Crown may be great indeed.

Therefore was created the Order of the Hospitallers of Albion, to reward and thank those gentles or groups who, while not subjects of Drachenwald, have shown unselfish service to our Kingdom and its Crown during these travels.

And so do their Majesties call before them ____________

# Part XIV Oaths

Oaths are a very personal thing and the ceremonies below should be taken as templates. Custom varied in period, as do preferences now, as to whether an oath is to the person or the office, to successors or not, what exactly is sworn to by the person giving the oath and whether it is done publicly or privately. The Crown, heralds and oath-givers should be flexible in how this aspect of fealty is handled.

## 1. Coronation Oath

Seneschal
: Will You love all that is true and fair, and fight all falsehoods, lies and injustice, both with Your Royal powers and with justice?

Coronets
: I will.

Seneschal
: Will You be true to Your people, confirm to them their old rights and privileges, and not take away from anyone what is rightfully theirs, except after proper verdict of law?

Coronets
: I will.

Seneschal
: Will You protect the Realm to the best of Your ability, so that when the time comes You will leave Your successors a strong Kingdom, as is their due?

Coronets
: I will.
