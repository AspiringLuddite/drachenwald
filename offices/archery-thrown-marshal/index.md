Drachenwald offers many opportunities to practice the important medieval skill of archery and to take part in competitions.

Archery is an accessible sport for all ages, and adapts well for people with disabilities. 

These documents outline how Drachenwald's marshals (who act as safety officers and organise tournaments) serve to make archery safe and fun for everyone, and how to teach and mentor new marshals. 

The Drachenwald Company of Archers is a 'guild' for archers, providing ranks and advancement with recognition from your fellow archers.

# Handbooks and authorisation forms
We take safety seriously. 'Authorisation' refers to a person who wants to become a marshal passing knowledge and practical tests to gain their marshalling warrant: a bit like taking a driving test before getting your license. 

* [Society-wide target archery and thrown weapons rules (2 documents)](https://www.sca.org/resources/document-library/#target-archery) provide a baseline of equipment guidance and range safety for archery marshals within the Society.
