excerpt: Glorious gifts of original artwork in medieval styles
---

Society royalty recognise those volunteers who contribute to the group with awards and honours. 

In Drachenwald we generate orginal artwork for each award. The documents that commemorate these awards, 'scrolls', are written and painted by hand individually, in the distinctive styles of the days (mostly) before the European printing press. 

The Signet Clerk coordinates the volunteer artists, scriveners, gilders and artisans to commission this art, from requests that come from the royalty. Collectively the artists are called 'scribes'.

The artists keep their assignments confidential until the Crown, Coronet or baron and baroness have presented them.
