excerpt: Materials we use to make beautiful art
---
The documents we use to mark new awards are, across the Society, called scrolls, though noone rolls them up. Also, occasionally, writs or letters.

We use the best quality materials we can, often as close to medieval examples as we can. 'Archival' refers to a quality of paper, ink and pigment that will not degrade or break down quickly.

Use archival materials (acid free paper, and light fast materials) where ever possible. Commercial materials often state 'archival' (or not) on their packaging and instructions.

The following materials are acceptable:

* Water colour paints
* Gouache
* Egg tempera
* Medieval pigments
* Water colour paper
* Vellum/parchment
* Pergamenata paper
* Archival print maker’s paper
* Inks that are light fast

The following materials are unacceptable:

* Felt tip calligraphy pens / colouring pens
* Colouring pencils
* Crayons
* Pantone pens (cartooning pens)
* Calligraphy imitation writing paper
* Newsprint paper
* Photocopy or printer paper

The signet clerk can make exceptions, on a case by case basis.

Scroll size is up to the scribe but consider costs and implications of framing non-standard sizes.

Scrolls should follow period traditions and examples. (Books of hours pages, writs and other such period documents)

Scrolls created on paper should be done so on paper with a weight no less than 250 g/m².

A scroll is the documentation for the award given and should be treated accordingly.

All scrolls must contain the following information on the back:

* Name of scribe: SCA and modern
* Contact information: post address or email address
* A general description for the time period, and style of the scroll (documentation)

All awards are important, and all scrolls matter. 

The office of the Signet Clerk has the right to refuse work that is deemed unacceptable.

By accepting a commission, a scribe is part of the confidential decisions of the Crown. You must keep secret those decisions, until the Crown announces those awards, and makes them public. Scribes who leak information about up and coming awards will not receive assignments.

Backlog scrolls (scrolls for awards that were announced in court, but for which there was no scroll ready) MUST be completed within six months of the assignment given date. (Exceptions may be made on a case by case basis)

No backlog scroll may be assigned without the approval of the Signet Clerk. Only the scroll approved by the Signet Clerk will be considered the official documentation of the award.

Award scrolls are NOT official unless they contain the signatures of the crown.

Proof of award must be provided. The following proofs are valid:
* online OP entry
* promissory note SIGNED by the king / queen
* Court report in the kingdom newsletter, _Dragon's Tale_
* Court report by email
