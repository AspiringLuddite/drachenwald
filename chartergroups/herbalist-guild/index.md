The Drachenwald Guild of Herbalists is a chartered Guild dedicated to herbalism
We will be focussing on Herbalism in period including knowledge that was assembled before and thus accessible in period to committed seekers of knowledge.

** Herbalism ** is the study, both theoretical and practical, of the characteristics and properties of such herbs, as found in nature or raised in gardens, and the exploration of their uses in the arts & sciences prior to 1600.


The term ** herbs ** is extended to mean all growing things considered to be plants in a pre-1600 context and all material derived from those plants (eg. root, stem, leaf, bark, fruit, seed), this does include fungi and lichen, algae as well as trees, fruit and vegetables.

The purpose of the guild is to educate us, each other and the populace on period use of herbs, safely introduce and excite the populace to flavors and the richness of period flora in all ways of use which included but were not limited to: Medicinal use in period (historic research), Culinary- In beverages and food, Ornamental: dyes and Cosmetic, Ritualistic & Alchemy, Gardening & Botany.
