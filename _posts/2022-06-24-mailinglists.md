We have a new home for the Drachenwald mailing list. This mailing list is for the entire populace of Drachenwald (and other interested parties) and sees event announcements, the occasional discussion and other important news.

We are now running the mailinglists from inside our Google Workspace as a google group.


You have two options on how to join:
Option 1: if you have a google account: [https://groups.google.com/a/drachenwald.sca.org/g/dw-l/](https://groups.google.com/a/drachenwald.sca.org/g/dw-l/)

Option 2: send an email to [dw-l+subscribe@drachenwald.sca.org](mailto:dw-l+subscribe@drachenwald.sca.org) from the email address you want to use for the mailing list, and follow the instruction you will receive in reply.

Once I have gotten the list of subscribers to the old list I will add them to the new list.
