Greetings Drachenwald!

We would remind you that there is less than a week left to send in your Letters of Intent for the upcoming Crown Tournament in Polderslot, on the 22–24 Oct 2021 (https://crown.polderslot.info/). The event team will be updating the travel information in the next few days after announcements made by the Dutch government. Please do not swamp them with questions before they are able to update the information :)

If you intend to compete for the right to sit upon the Black Dragon Thrones, you need to send your Letter of Intent to Us and to the Kingdom Seneschal: "crown AT drachenwald.sca.org", and "seneschal AT drachenwald.sca.org"

Your letter of intent needs to be sent in before Friday September 24th, i.e. before midnight on Thursday the 23rd.

More information on participation can be found here:

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact Us or Our Seneschal.

Warm regards,
Æríkr and Jacquelyna,
King and Queen of the Long Reign of Drachenwald
