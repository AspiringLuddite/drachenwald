Greetings Drachenwald!

During this period of time, when the majority of the Kingdoms have enacted Covid-19 precautions, the SCA Board of Directors allows official business meetings (courts, curia, A&S competitions) in Drachenwald to be held on-line. We have set up the following guidelines for you and your groups to follow when you hold on-line meetings. Note: Other on-line gatherings in Drachenwald, such as A&S classes, or general meetings that are not conducting official business are not required to be pre-scheduled or announced. You can find the guidelines at at this URL: https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/files/covid19-online.pdf
