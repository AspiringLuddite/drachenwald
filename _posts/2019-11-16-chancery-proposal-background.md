_The King and Queen of Drachenwald have [called for a Curia]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-12-call-to-curia %}) to take place in January at Twelfth Night Coronation. When a change to Kingdom Law is being considered, a Curia is an opportunity for the people of Drachenwald to comment on the proposed changes. At this curia, two changes are proposed. [The previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-13-precedence-proposal %}) covered the proposal to change the Order of Precedence. The other, detailed here, proposes changes to the office of Signet. This post contains the background briefing of the Chancery proposal received by the Crown._

# Chancery Proposal Background

## Situation

It is an unhappy tradition in some parts of the SCA to name the person in charge of organising the calligraphy, painting and illumination of diplomata for kingdoms and principalities the "clerk of the signet". This is to a great extent because scribal artists have been administered as subordinate officials.

This is unfortunate because it names the officer after a lowly official in the English chancellery system (the clerks of the signet copied bills of the privy signet as an intermediate stage in the preparation of letters patent), which minimises the work done by the officer and by the scribes, painters and illuminators who contribute so much of their time and effort.

Kingdoms give varying titles to their chief administrators of scribal work.  Some are signet clerks, but many have heraldic titles or are called Chief Scribe.  These titles generally reflect that the scribes are or have been subordinate to colleges of heralds.  Yet none of these gives due prominence to the work of a kingdom's scribes; and all ignore the work of painters, illuminators and limners who work to create gorgeous artwork but who are not strictly scribes.

## Proposal

That since the office of Clerk of the Signet has been made into a Great Office of State in Drachenwald it would be renamed the office of the Crown Chancellor; and

That at the same time the body of scribes, painters, limners and illuminators in Drachenwald become collectively the Crown Chancery, and if they incorporate themselves as a College they should also be chartered a College of Scribes, Painters, Limners, Stainers and Illuminators.  The two need not be identical because not all scribes who might join a College necessarily execute work for the Crown.

## Timing

A decision on this is required before convening Parliament at Drachenwald 20th Anniversary.

## Background

The appropriate mediaeval title for the officer who manages a king's or prince's paperwork is the Latin cancellarius which becomes in English the Chancellor, in German the Kanzler, in Bulgarian the канцлер, in Swedish as kansler, in Finnish the kansleri, in Icelandic the kanslari and in Hungarian the kancellár.  The office itself is in English the Chancellery or Chancery with comparable translations in other European languages.

Naming the chief officer for state papers the "Crown Chancellor", "Royal Chancellor" or "Lord/Lady Chancellor" firmly sets the officer among the grandly named kingdom officers:  the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Earl Marshal et cetera.  The purse in which the Great Seal was kept by the Lord Chancellor of England (and his colleagues in Scotland, Ireland and on the Continent) makes a splendid and practical token of office.  The Writ of Summons which appointed English bishops to the post would make an excellent exemplar for appointing new incumbents to the post.

Mediaeval European kings and princes, regardless of country or time period, used the term Chancellor for the chiefs of their scribes and the holders of their seals.

- The position of Chancellor of France and Keeper of the Seals was first filled by St Remigius, then Rémy, Bishop of Rheims in service to Clovis.
- The Carolingian Holy Roman Emperors appointed archchancellors (in Latin archicancellarius), a post which continued through the history of the Holy Roman Empire.  As the post became firmly welded to certain bishoprics the position of Court Chancellor (in German Hofkanzler) arose in the late 15th and in the 16th Century to balance the power of the Erkanzler, the Archbishop of Mainz.
- The Chancellor of England and Keeper of the Great Seal, was a position first filled after the Norman Conquest in 1068 by Herfast, later Bishop of Elmham, later Bishop of Thetford.
- The King's Chancellor of Sweden was an office known from the 13th Century, and elevated to the post of rikskansler in the 16th Century.
- Scotland had a Lord Chancellor from 1124.
- Ireland had its own Lord High Chancellor from 1186.
- Poland had a kanclerz koronni or Crown Chancellor from the 14th Century, divided into the offices of Great Chancellor and Deputy Chancellor in the 15th Century. Before that each Polish prince had his own kanclerz.
- It would not be an exaggeration to say that every ruling prince in Europe had a chancellor looking after the paperwork.  In many cases the chancellor of the crown was also responsible for certain royal courts.

The SCA already replicates one use of the term from English practice, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; who in England was responsible for the paperwork in the royal Court of Exchequer.  Drachenwald has another chancellor, the Chancellor of the University of Drachenwald, whose title reflects the great antiquity of the same title in the Middle Ages.  The first chancellor of the University of Oxford, for instance, was the great Robert Grossteste who was elected in the early 13th Century.

## SCA Law and Precedent

 Not all kingdoms use the term 'clerk of the signet' for their chief officer of diplomata.  In general, the title of chiefs of scribes seems to have been replicated from parent kingdoms, and some have descriptive titles (Kingdom Scribe), some have heraldic titles (e.g. Plume pursuivant), some have academic titles (Chancellor or Provost) and some have combinations of heraldic titles with the term "signet" (Topaz Signet).  There is clearly no SCA-wide practice for naming this office.

Eight do not:

- The West, the first kingdom in the SCA has a Chancellor of Scribes.
- Atenveldt has a Kingdom Scribe.
- Meridies has Parchment Pursuivant
- Caid has a Scribe Armarius
- An Tir has Sable Sable, the Kingdom Scribe
- The Outlands has a Kingdom Scribe
- Artemisia has Sable Plume Pursuivant
- Lochac has a Provost of Scribes (with a gorgeous College of Scribes web site)

Nine do:

- The East Kingdom has a Tyger Clerk of the Signet
- Ansteorra has a Star Signet
- Atlantia has a Clerk Signet
- Calontir has Falcon Signet
- Trimaris has Chart Signet (and a splendid web site)
- Aethelmearc has Sylvan Signet
- Ealdormere has both Trillium Signet and the Lady Privy Seal
- Northshield has Polaris Signet.
- Gleann Abhann has Topaz Signet

Corpora mandate kingdom great officers which mirror Society officers, but do not mandate any others.  Corpora mandate reporting and approval between Society officers and comparable kingdom officers, but leave blank any responsibility between the Society and kingdom officers without matching Society portfolios.  The Governing Documents of the SCA Inc and proposed revisions are otherwise silent on the naming of kingdom great officers.

Kingdom law demands: 12.04 It should be the duty and responsibility of all members of the Kingdom of Drachenwald to maintain and increase Authenticity, the Spirit and the Willingness to create a Current Middle Ages.  This seems to demand a positive duty to be guided by mediaeval exemplars.  No current Drachenwald law would restrict naming the chief officer for royal diplomata the Chancellor.  Revisions to Drachenwald law as currently published foresee no changes which should prove problematical.
