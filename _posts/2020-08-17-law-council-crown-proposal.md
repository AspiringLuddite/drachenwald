Greetings from [Drachenwald Law Council](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/law-council/)!

# Call for comments on event requirements for Crown Tournament participation

Drachenwald Law Council is currently considering whether the section of the law that defines the amount and timing of events that Crown Tournament participants must have attended needs updating. [Please take a moment to read about this and fill in a small questionnaire](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/lawproposal2_v0/) by August 31.

# Updated proposals

In July the Law Council requested feedback on two draft law proposals regarding gender requirements for Crown Tournament participation and Kingdom awards. Thanks to everyone who helped the Law Council and the Kingdom by studying the draft proposals and seeing how they could be improved! 

The proposals have now been revisited based on the feedback received. Please see [a detailed response to the feedback as well as updated versions of the proposals](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/lawproposal1_v2/).
