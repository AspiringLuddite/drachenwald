A bit of a boast from The Kingdom University Team - we have 360 registered attendees, 150 of these are out of Kingdom visitors. 21 are attending their first SCA event.

38 of Drachenwald's groupa are covered. All 20 of the 20 SCA kingdoms are in attendance. 29 countries are zooming in for it.

We have 72 classes on offer on such topics as cooking, camping, garb, embriodery, weaving, calligraphy and illumination, heraldry, herbalism, cosmetics, jewellery, dancing, music, bone carving, bookbinding, astronomy and much more.

Besides all these interesting classes there will be Court, a feast, a ball, Guild meetings, and social activities.
