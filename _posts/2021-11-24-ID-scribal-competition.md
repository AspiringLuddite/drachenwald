Announcing: the Insulae Draconis blank competition! Sponsored by Their Highnesses and the signet office.

YOU COULD WIN GOLD!

That’s right. The prize is a pack of 25 sheets of 24 carat transfer gold. Double thick, because that’s the way I roll. (And it does make a visible difference, imho.)

Between now and 25 March (Lady day, a rent day), send me, the signet of the isles, blanks for the use of Insulae Draconis. For each scroll you send me I will put your name into a hat. Three blanks, three entries to win gold. Ten blanks, ten chances.

On 26 March, I will draw a single name out of the hat, ask for the winner’s address, and send them gold.

All scribes in the kingdom or who hold a PCS are welcome to submit.

Please PM or email me at daylightjam at gmail dot com for my address when you are ready to ship.

Thank all of you for the work you do!

Ari Mala

Insulae Draconis signet officer
