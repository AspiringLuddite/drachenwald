Please find below the latest update from SCA Inc regarding the current Corona situation and how it pertains to SCA events. 

The authority within the SCA to cancel, reschedule, or postpone events lies with the group hosting the event (Kingdom(s), Barony, Shire, etc.).   Event planners should take into account directives from legal authorities (municipal, county, state, federal) and current guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) when making such a decision.

If the event in question is required by SCA Corpora, please follow the guidelines therein for requesting a variance to postpone the event through your Kingdom Seneschal.   Any such requests will be reviewed in an expeditious manner at the corporate level.

The SCA remains supportive of Kingdoms and groups who continue to hold events as well as those that must cancel, reschedule, or postpone events for safety reasons or who have been directed to cancel events by modern civil authorities.  Our primary concern must always be the health and safety of our members and participants.   The Board will continue to monitor the situation and will communicate further when needed.
