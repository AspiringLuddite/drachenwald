We hope you are all enjoying Kingdom University thus far! This is your reminder that the Feast, the Drachenwald Royal Court, and the Kingdom University Ball are all happening this evening, Saturday 28th November, at 6pm, 7pm and 8pm CET respectively, in the Leiden room.
In case you missed the previous announcement, we are thrilled that Gaita (http://www.gaita.co.uk/) will be providing music for our Ball tonight! See the list of dances below.
The medieval music ensemble Gaita is dedicated to performing medieval music from the courts of Europe from the 1200-1500 (from France, Italy, Spain, and Scotland) in an historically informed style. A particular focus is on reconstructing the music and choreographies of the dances of the 15th C; from the Italian masters, Burgundian sources and the Gresley manuscript. You can check out their work here:
