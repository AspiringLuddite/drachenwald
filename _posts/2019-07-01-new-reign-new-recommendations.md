In late June in Polderslot, the people of Drachenwald saw their Graces William and Isabetta step down, and welcomed the reign of their Majesties, Vitus and Isabel.

The page describing our [king and queen is now up to date]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link royals/index.html %}).

Their Majesties' courts feature award presentations: recognitions for those who have contributed measureably to the kingdom. 

To know who is due their recognition, their Majesties rely on recommendations from the people of these lands.

See the [Drachenwald Awards and Orders]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/herald/drachenwaldawardsorders.md %}) page to learn of these honours.

Read the [Society awards and recommendations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link offices/herald/society-awards-personal-view.md %}), an article by yours truly, to help understand how our awards 'work'.

[Click to submit a recommendation via online form](http://op.drachenwald.sca.org/recommend). These recommendations go to the Crown, or to the royals you specify, via their email alias.
