#CURIA AGENDA
## 1. Review proposed Drachenwald law changes

Copies of the proposed changes may be found in the March 2021 issue of the Dragon's Tale and on the [Kingdom website](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/lawproposal3_v1/)

### a. Revisions and reformatting of Drachenwald law section 1
The first section in the current law is somewhat difficult to read and has problems conveying its intentions. This proposal restructures and partially rewrites it.

### b. Revisions to Drachenwald law sections 2-5
The main motivation behind these changes is to remove gender specificity where it isn’t needed or it is inconsistent with other parts of the law.
     
## 2. Any new business
