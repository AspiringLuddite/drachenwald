One of the most important parts of our game is to make sure that everyone is having fun, and feels safe and welcomed!

With that in mind, Sol will be leading a class tomorrow, Sun 29 Nov, at 9am CET in the Cambridge room, to discuss what unwelcome behavior can look like in the SCA, strategies for bystander intervention, and how to make the SCA safer for our more vulnerable participants. Attendees will roleplay scenarios to practice intervention skills--be prepared to act as bully, target, bystander, and observer. Suitable for participants 12 years old and up.
