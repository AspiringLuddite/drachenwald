We are thrilled to announce that Gaita (http://www.gaita.co.uk/) will be providing music for our Ball on Saturday night! See the list of dances below.
The medieval music ensemble Gaita is dedicated to performing medieval music from the courts of Europe from the 1200-1500 (from France, Italy, Spain, and Scotland) in an historically informed style. A particular focus is on reconstructing the music and choreographies of the dances of the 15th C; from the Italian masters, Burgundian sources and the Gresley manuscript. You can check out their work here:
