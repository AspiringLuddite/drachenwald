Greetings from [Drachenwald Law Council](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/law-council/)!

# Please give feedback on the new draft law proposals

The Drachenwald Law Council has published new draft law proposals for your commentary! These draft proposals cover the Glossary, and Drachenwald law sections 5 (Kingdom officers and their duties)) and 7.02.2.8.2 (event requirements for Crown Tournament participation). Please provide your feedback on the draft proposals no later than on Sun 21 Feb 2021, using the web form at the end of the [proposal page on the kingdom website](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/lawproposal4_v0/)

You can [meet the Law Council online](https://drachenwald.sca.org/events/calendar/#/drachenwald/2021-02-16/drachenwald-law-council-q-a) and make any questions you have on Tuesday 16 February. Please drop by!

This is the first round of our new legislative process where everyone gets to comment on the proposals while they are still in the preparation phase. The received feedback will be considered by the Law Council when preparing each proposal to be recommended to Crown.
