Greetings unto Our wonderful populace of Drachenwald!

We have some good news to share with you all. In response to the writ with which We presented him last August, where We announced that We wish to elevate him to the Order of Defense, Baron Antonio di Rienzo Ruspoli has recently expressed to Us that it is his wish to give Us his reply during the online event Plague Wars. Thus, allowing his friends from all over the Known World to join him for this grand occasion.

Therefore, let it be known that His Excellency, Baron Antonio di Rienzo Ruspoli, will be put on vigil during Our first Royal court of Plague Wars, on Thursday evening, May 13th, which will start at 21:00 CEST (UTC +2 hours).

His vigil will continue throughout the day on Friday, to give as many people as possible a chance to talk with him.

We look forward to receiving his answer during Our court on Saturday evening, the 15th of May, which will begin at 18:00 CEST (UTC +2 hours).

More details on how to register and join will follow later.

Warm regards,
Æríkr and Jacquelyna,
King and Queen of the Long Reign
