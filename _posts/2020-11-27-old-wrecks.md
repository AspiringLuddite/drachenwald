Warm-up week is drawing to a close, with a mere 6 hours until the official start and opening ceremony of Drachenwald Kingdom University!!

With that in mind, the team behind DKU would like to remind you of some of the fantastic classes taking place this weekend!
For example, Baron Antonio di Rienzo Ruspoli is teaching a class on "Old wrecks for re-enactors: Mary Rose and friends", looking at examples, limitations, and finds of shipwrecks, and how they can help us understand the past.

Join us at Drachenwald Kingdom University in the Year of the Long Reign for this and other general history classes, marked by a castle symbol on the classlist and schedule.
