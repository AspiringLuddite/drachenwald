A few small updates to the [events calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/calendar/index.md %}):

- there's a button to hide cancelled events
- fixed the messy display when a country is not specified
- the online events icon is now in the legend
- the iCal calendar should no longer include cancelled events

These changes also propagate automatically to the calendars on the [Aros](https://aros.nordmark.org/events/) and [Insulae Draconis](https://insulaedraconis.org/Events/) sites. If you'd like to use the Drachenwald calendar (or a subset) on your website, give the web team a shout.
