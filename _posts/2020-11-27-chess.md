Good morning! 
In the spirit of exercising your brain and warming it up for the deluge of information that will be coming your way in Kingdom University over the weekend... learn to play medieval chess!

Baron Etienne Fevre De Dion teaches us the basics of two period versions of this game of kings in this two-part video series.

The first video is on the Rules of Medieval Chess from Spain, from the Book of Games of Alphonso X (1283), which you can play using a modern chess set.

The second video is on The Rules of Byzantine or Circular Chess, Persia, from Muhammad ibn Mahmud Amuli's 'Treasury of the Sciences' (1325 CE).  In this video, Etienne shows how the pieces move and how victory is achieved. It shows enough that you can learn to play this form of circular medieval chess.
