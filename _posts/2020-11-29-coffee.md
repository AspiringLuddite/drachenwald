Welcome to the last day of Drachenwald Kingdom University!

If you are looking for the perfect cure after the ball last night, or something to perk you up before tonight's Bardic, look no further than Muâ€™allim Ahmad al-Siddiq al-Yamani's class, this evening at 7pm CET in the Urbino room, on coffee.

This will introduce the history of coffee in period, predominantly focussed on the Arab Near East. It will also include some practicalities for preparing coffee in a period-appropriate style.
