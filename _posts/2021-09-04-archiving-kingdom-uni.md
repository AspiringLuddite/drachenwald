Last year kingdom university was fully online. This means we set up a dedicated online presence and collected course materials online to make it easier for participants. This year there will be a new kingdom university with classes and handouts, and it would make sense for kingdomuniversity.drachenwald.sca.org to refer to this years Kingdom university. We have archived last years materials to  https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/unichancellor/ku2020/ and this years team will be able to put up their own website for this years university.
