Greetings Drachenwald!

TL/DR:
- In the coming days, the OP website will display additional information (where consent is given).
- See example: <https://op.drachenwald.sca.org/persona/Memorantia%20van%20de%20Linde>.
- Use the "modern name" button on your page to send in your info, should you want it displayed.
- Reminder that you can send heraldic images to posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org.
- Call for help: Posthorn needs help resizing or even creating heraldic images from scratch.


The webteam and Posthorn present to you the newest revision of the Order of Precedence (OP) website, which will go live in the next few days.

## Part 1: Modern names, titles, and pronouns

In this revision, we have implemented the answers provided in the consent form that was launched last summer.

As an example of how your information could look, check out this page: <https://op.drachenwald.sca.org/persona/Memorantia%20van%20de%20Linde> (shared with permission)

We encourage you to look up yourself and send in additional information using the new button "Submit your modern name, pronouns, and preferred title".

## Part 2: Displaying heraldic devices

A reminder also that we are accepting images of heraldic devices. Send an email to <posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org> with your device attached:

1. File size must be 177x212 pixels.
2. File format should be PNG (or SVG).
3. The file should have a transparent background.
4. Include a link to your OP entry in the email.
5. An heraldic blazon (the text description) MUST be written in the email.

### Important:

- The image of your device should ONLY be of your device.
- Do NOT send the complete submission file from when you registered your device.
- Do NOT send a photograph of your device.

Posthorn sometimes needs help resizing or even creating heraldic images from scratch. If you have illustration skills and are willing to help out, please reach out to me. Volume has probably been once every other month up until now, so unless the populace decides to flood the office with new requests, this should not be a very time-consuming task.


Yours In Service,<br>
