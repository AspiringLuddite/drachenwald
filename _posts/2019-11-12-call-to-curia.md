Their Majesties Vitus and Isabel, give notice that they intend to hold a Curia Regis, at 12th Night Coronation held in the Barony of Aarnimetsä on Saturday 4th January at 9:00am.

There are 2 proposed Kingdom law changes that the Curia must consider. The first matter is a proposed change to the name of the Signet Clerk and the second is a change in the Order of Precedence.

All Greater Officers of the Kingdom should make every effort to attend. If they are unable to do so, they may send a designated representative, or make their comments known to the Crown and Kingdom Seneschal in writing, prior to the day of the Curia. Members of the populace may also send comments in writing.

Note that these proposed changes are being put before the Curia for discussion. The outcome of that discussion may be that any of the proposed changes may be rejected, or altered before being implemented into Kingdom Law.

Feedback can be sent to [seneschal@drachenwald.sca.org](mailto:seneschal@drachenwald.sca.org). Please note that the official feedback channel is only via email, so do ensure that you send your feedback to this address so it can be taken into consideration.

# Proposed changes to Kingdom Law

## Item 1 – Proposal to rename the Office of Signet Clerk Office to the Office of the Crown Chancellor

The Governing Documents of the SCA Inc and proposed revisions are silent on the naming of kingdom great officers. Naming the chief officer for state papers the "Crown Chancellor", firmly sets the officer among the grandly named kingdom officers. At the same time the body of scribes, painters, limners and illuminators in Drachenwald become collectively the Crown Chancery.

### Current Text

5.01 The Great Officers of the Kingdom of Drachenwald are, in the order of Precedence, as follows:

* Kingdom Seneschal
* Schwarzdrachen Herald
* Kingdom Earl Marshal
* Kingdom Minister of Arts and Sciences
* Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer
* Kingdom Chronicler
* Kingdom Signet Clerk
* Kingdom Web Minister

5.04.1.1 The terms of office for Kingdom Officers begin on the following dates: The Monday after Twelfth Night Coronation (on odd numbered years Gregorian)

- Historian
- University Chancellor
- Web Minister

The Monday after Midsummer Coronation (on odd numbered years Gregorian)

- Seneschal
- Chronicler
- Social Media Officer
- Marshal of Fence

The Monday after Twelfth Night Coronation (even numbered years Gregorian)

- Arts and Sciences
- Earl-Marshal
- Signet Clerk
- Chatelaine

5.06.8 Signet Clerk

5.06.8.1 Shall oversee the production of scrolls required by the Crown.

5.06.8.2 Shall promote the development of calligraphers and illuminators in Drachenwald.

6.01.2 Territorial Princes and Princesses may acknowledge the attainment of Viscounty rank and those without a Patent of Arms by some other Peerage shall be polled for one. The Principality Seneschal shall conduct this poll 2 months prior to Principality Tourney by a poll of all Patent Holding Royal Peers within the Principality. The results of the poll will be submitted to the Crown 30 days in advance of the Tourney. If, after the polling, the Crown decides that the Prince and/or Princess meets Corpora standards, the Crown may then bestow the Patent and have the writ prepared by the Signet in time for the Tourney. The writ may be presented by the new Prince and Princess in the Crowns’ name if the Crown is not available at the Tourney.

## Item 2 - Proposed changes the Drachenwald Order of Precedence

The current order of march in Drachenwald Law is based on a generic order of rank and precedence in the Society. It fails to take into account Drachenwald's unique lands structure and fails to observe the relations amongst and between the Drachenwald principalities and baronies. This change resolves the problem in addressing the two kinds of baronies Drachenwald has; those that are fiefs directly to the throne of Drachenwald and those that are part of a principality.

### Current Text

13.08. The order of Precedence of Drachenwald.

The order of Precedence shall be as follows

1. King and Queen of Drachenwald.
2. Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Drachenwald.
3. Territorial Prince and Princess of Drachenwald Principalities.
4. The Crown's appointed representatives of a Crown Principality (such as a Viceroy and/or Vicereine).
5. A Territorial Baron/ess in their own barony, acting as baron/ess - otherwise see #10
6. Duke/Duchess
7. Count/Countess.
8. Viscount/ess.
9. Bestowed peers
10. Territorial Barons and Baronesses.
11. Court Baron and Baroness.
12. Awards that carry a grant of arms.
13. Plain grants of arms. Lord or Lady name.
14. Awards that carry an award of arms.
