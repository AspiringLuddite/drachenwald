Good morning SCAdians, 

To day 2 of warm-up week! Only three and a half days until Kingdom University kicks off on Friday evening.

This morning's offering is a video of tips and tricks from the inimitable Lord Duncan Chaucer, guiding us through some basic blade maintenance including removing nicks and burrs, cleaning rust and replacing tips.

{% include video id="WVGNiXhitzI" provider="youtube" %}

If this video leaves you with burning questions, Duncan is hosting a Q&A at 14:00 CET/ 13:00 GMT on Sunday. There are also a host of other martial classes happening over the weekend - look for classes with the symbol of two crossed swords on the schedule and/or classlist!
