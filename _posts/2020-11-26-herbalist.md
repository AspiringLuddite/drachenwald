Almost exactly 24 hours until Drachenwald Kingdom University properly kicks off, and you know what that means!

Join Lady Cecily Ardene and the Herbalist's Guild at 8pm CET on Friday 26th in the Sorbonne room for a Show & Tell, open to anyone to make a very short presentation about a herbal/plant-related project. That could be anything from sharing some pictures from a foraging walk to showing off the results of natural plant-based dyeing. Taking questions from the audience is entirely optional (we know it's not always easy to answer on the spot, especially in a second language). You don't have to have a project to share to join in, you can just enjoy admiring other people's stuff.

Join us at Drachenwald Kingdom University in the Year of the Long Reign. November 23rd to 29th.
