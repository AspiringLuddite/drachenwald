The kingdom of Drachenwald is aware of extremist groups using a dragon resembling the Albion dragon in the Drachenwald arms with or without a laurel wreath as a part of their symbols. Both the dragon and the laurel wreath are historical symbols with many uses since long before the SCA was formed. We want to make it clear that there is no relation between the SCA and any extremist groups. In accordance with Corpora X.A.4 we as a kingdom do not tolerate hate speech or symbols.
