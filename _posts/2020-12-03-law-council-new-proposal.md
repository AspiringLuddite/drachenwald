Greetings from [Drachenwald Law Council](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/law-council/)!

# Please give feedback on the new draft law proposals

The Drachenwald Law Council has published new draft law proposals for your commentary. These draft proposals cover Drachenwald law sections 1-5.

This is the first round of our new legislative process where everyone gets to comment on the proposals while they are still in the preparation phase. The received feedback will be considered by the Law Council when preparing each proposal to be recommended to Crown. If Crown decides to advance the proposal to a future Curia, you will then have a second opportunity to comment on it.

To make sure the proposals are clear, we wish to provide an opportunity for making questions about them. You can [meet the Law Council online on Tuesday 15 December](https://drachenwald.sca.org/events/calendar/#/). Please drop by!

Please provide your feedback on the draft proposals no later than Friday 18 December 2020, using the web form at the end of the [proposal page on the kingdom website](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/seneschal/lawproposal3_v0/)
