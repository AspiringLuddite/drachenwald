excerpt: "Order of the laurel is seeking input on virtual gatherings with Drachenwald's artisans"
---
Ordinarily, the summer events give Laurels and artisans several opportunities to gather and enjoy discussions of the various arts and sciences being pursued in our Kingdom.  These gatherings have been run at various events as Laurels' Sponsored Prize Displays- a competition-free, low pressure way for artisans to show their work and gather feedback, and for the Order of the Laurel to help support artisans across the Kingdom and see what wonderful things Drachenwald's artisans are creating.

As we are unfortunately unable to gather this summer, the Order of the Laurel would like to explore online ways to gather with the artisans of our Kingdom.  Could you please therefore fill out the below survey if you would be interested in joining an online Laurels' Prize Display, in whatever form(s) it may take.  Thank you very much, and we look forward to gathering with the artisans of the Kingdom!
