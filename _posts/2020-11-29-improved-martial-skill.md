This weekend has flown by and it's hard to believe that Kingdom University is already nearly over.

There is still a wide variety of classes on offer, and you can catch a couple before the closing ceremony later this afternoon! One such class is being led by Lord Ranulf li Norreis, who will be teaching a systematic approach to improved martial skill, at 4pm CET in the Urbino room.

Learn how to apply proven sports training methods for physical fitness, mental tenacity, and skill development to your preferred SCA martial activity. Taught from the perspective of a heavy fighter, but applicable to all martial arts.
