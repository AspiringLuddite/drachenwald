**DrachenwaldTry3 is keeping your knives sharp**

Next to nominate a challenge is Lord Kheldor, of Nordmark, who is skilled in working with metals. As most of us don’t have a forge at home, the challenge is to take proper care of the knives in your SCA kit (or indeed, in your modern kitchen).

Whetstones were used to sharpen blades throughout the ancient and medieval worlds and are often found in the archaeological record. Here is a Viking era stone, with runes: [www.atlasobscura.com/articles/found-viking-stone-carved-runes](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/found-viking-stone-carved-runes)

For beginners, here is a tutorial (video and text) covering the correct technique, angle and so on, using a modern purpose-made whetstone: [www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-sharpen-knife-with-whetstone-995817](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-sharpen-knife-with-whetstone-995817)

But if you don’t have one of those, there are other options: [www.theknifehub.com/sharpen-knife-without-sharpener](https://www.theknifehub.com/sharpen-knife-without-sharpener/?fbclid=IwAR0nO1-OoqnaMT8f0xJAmAb8qqmvj4ZLPESvCRFSGIv63NcT7Z5jbNVgijk)

For those in countries where ceramic fuses are available, Lord Kheldor has created a useful sharpening steel. Here’s how to make your own:  

Material needed: A fuse, a screw, some leather for shims, something to handle.
Tools: file, abrasive cloth, screwdriver & pliers.

Remove the "hats", clear the contents and mount a small handle.

As we’re sure you don’t need telling, take extra care when sharpening your knives – give the task your full attention and don’t do it with other people running around nearby. A trip to hospital for stitches is always annoying, but certainly best avoided right now.

Please share pictures of your well-cared for knives in the #DrachenwaldTry3 hashtag on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, or in the Facebook group called “DW A&S”. The deadline before the next draw will be Wednesday 8th April.
