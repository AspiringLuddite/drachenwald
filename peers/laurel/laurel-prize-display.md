## Laurel sponsored Prize Displays

The Laurel sponsored Prize Displays is a project that comes to Drachenwald inspired by The Garden of Earthly Delights and the Laurels Prize in Lochac.

## What is a Laurel sponsored Prize Display? - [A presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eYwD_I3MiaJRlcUxzlecS-RINJPHfP0mJwmtJr1Ep6U/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p)

* It is __not__ a competition
* It is a chance for people from all over the Kingdom to gather and share what they have been working on lately
* Your chance to learn from another artisan who may have solved the problem you were struggling with
* All artisans who display, and all gentles who come by to have a look are encouraged to bring tokens[1] to leave for those displays that inspire them
* The Laurels of Drachenwald who attend will each give a prize to the display and artisan who inspired them most that day

[1] A token can be things like: Chocolate, a written note, a bead, a replica coin, a braid, some crackers, anything small and shiny, a small snack… whatever you can think of, signed with the giver’s name or not.

## Who can participate?
You can: anyone who is not a Laurel can display their work!

* If you have made something
* If you want to share your craft or findings
* If you can talk about what you have done and why

## How do I display?
* Bring your finished (or nearly finished) item
* Bring some books or pictures of other sources that inspired you
* Bring some of the materials or starting points of your project
* Set up in the space you are allocated to show how you made your item
* Sit with your display and talk about it with everyone who comes by

Remember - if your craft is large, unwieldy or outdoors, you can leave a note and picture at an empty spot in the display area directing people to where you are. And be prepared to talk to people coming by to find you. Examples of this type of display can be: An entire tent with soft furnishings, a working kiln for smelting iron, a cooking demonstration over an open fire.

If you bring documentation, make it short enough that the main points can be glanced at and talked around, rather than an essay. The display is meant to encourage interaction. Bullet points, and reference images for example.
