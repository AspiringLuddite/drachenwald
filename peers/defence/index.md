title: Order of Defence
---

The Order of Defense is a Society-wide order, which recognises excellence in the arts of rapier and/or cut-and-thrust combat.  It is equal in dignity to orders of [Chivalry]({% link peers/chivalry/index.md %}), the [Laurel]({% link peers/laurel/index.md %}), and the [Pelican]({% link peers/pelican/index.md %}).

It is a consulting or 'polling' order, meaning that the king and queen choose who to invite to the order, after consulting with the existing members. Typically this consultation includes a discussion period and a poll.
