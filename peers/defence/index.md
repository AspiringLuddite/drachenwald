title: Order of Defence
---

<!--The 'bestowed peerages' refer to those peerages which come from the hand of the king and queen. 
NB: this seems confusing for newcomers, unless an explanation of what a non-bestowed peerage is-->

The Order of Defense is a Society-wide order, which recognises excellence in the arts of rapier and/or cut-and-thrust combat.  It is equal in dignity to orders of Chivalry, the Laurel, and the Pelican.
<!-- NB ideally this would link to those pages, or is that too wiki-like?-->

It is a consulting or 'polling' order, meaning that the king and queen choose who to invite to the order, after consulting with the existing members. Typically this consultation includes a discussion period and a poll. 

The order secretary is Master Alexandre Lerot d'Avign&eacute; (Jeff Berry) Email nexus@panix.com
